  The Basic Income Lab reviews the vast interdisciplinary research produced on
  UBI, identify under-explored research questions, and help shape future
  directions in basic income research.
heading1: Our Mission and Purpose
body1: >-
  The Stanford Basic Income Lab aspires to be an academic home for the study of
  universal basic income. It reviews the vast interdisciplinary research
  produced on UBI, identify under-explored research questions, and help shape
  future directions in basic income research. The Lab both guides researchers
  and experimenters who seek to conduct innovative research on UBI and hires
  scholars to produce new research. BIL also convenes key stakeholders and
  members of the community around the politics, philosophy and economics of
  basic income and informs policymakers and practitioners about best practices
  in UBI experimentation.


  The Stanford Basic Income Lab was founded in February 2017 as an initiative of
  the [Stanford McCoy Family Center for Ethics in
  Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). Under the leadership of
  Associate Professor Juliana Bidadanure and the support and guidance of Joan
  Berry, Executive Director of the McCoy Family Center of Ethics in Society, the
  Basic Income Lab received seed funding from the Economic Security Project and
  the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society to create an academic home for
  the study and evaluation of basic income experiments.

heading3: Why Basic Income?
body3: >-
  As automation, growing inequalities, persistent poverty, social precariousness
  and structural unemployment threaten economic security both in the United
  States and around the world, many policymakers, practitioners, academics and
  policymakers have begun to consider Universal Basic Income (UBI) to address
  these issues.


  Within this context, there is an increasing need for in-depth academic
  research on how to design, implement and evaluate UBI; on what UBIâ€™s potential
  impacts could be; and, on how it could be turned into an economically and
  politically feasible program.
heading4: Why Here?
body4: >-
  Increasingly in the United States, many express their support for Universal
  Basic Income. In 2016, Robert B. Reich, Andrew Stern and Martin Ford all wrote
  books proposing UBI as a necessary tool in an increasingly unequal and
  automated economy. 


  Stanford University offers a unique set of interdisciplinary opportunities to
  further enhance the study of this proposal. Nestled in the heart of the bay
  area, the Lab benefits from access to experts across disciplines to develop
  and improve UBI research.
