  The Stanford Basic Income Lab aspires to be an academic home for the study of
  universal basic income. We review the vast interdisciplinary research produced
  on UBI, identify under-explored research questions, and help shape future
  directions in basic income research. The lab both guides researchers and
  experimenters who seek to conduct innovative research on UBI and hires
  scholars to produce new research. BIL also convenes key stakeholders and
  members of the community around the politics, philosophy and economics of
  basic income and informs policymakers and practitioners about best practices
  in UBI experimentation.
