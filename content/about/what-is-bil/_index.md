  The Stanford Basic Income Lab aspires to be an academic home for the study of
  universal basic income. We review the vast interdisciplinary research produced
  on UBI, identify under-explored research questions, and help shape future
  directions in basic income research. The lab both guides researchers and
  experimenters who seek to conduct innovative research on UBI and hires
  scholars to produce new research. BIL also convenes key stakeholders and
  members of the community around the politics, philosophy and economics of
  basic income and informs policymakers and practitioners about best practices
  in UBI experimentation.


  The purpose of the Basic Income Lab is to foster research and promote a more
  informed public discussion about basic income and its potential to alleviate
  poverty, precariousness and inequality.


  The Stanford Basic Income Lab was founded in February 2017 as an initiative of
  the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society. Under the leadership of
  Associate Professor Juliana Bidadanure and the support and guidance of Joan
  Berry, Executive Director of the McCoy Family Center of Ethics in Society, the
  Basic Income Lab received seed funding from the Economic Security Project and
  the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society to create an academic home for
  the study and evaluation of basic income experiments.
