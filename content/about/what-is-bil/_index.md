heading1: Our Mission and Purpose
body1: >-
  The Stanford Basic Income Lab aspires to be an academic home for the study of
  universal basic income. We review the vast interdisciplinary research produced
  on UBI, identify under-explored research questions, and help shape future
  directions in basic income research. The lab both guides researchers and
  experimenters who seek to conduct innovative research on UBI and hires
  scholars to produce new research. BIL also convenes key stakeholders and
  members of the community around the politics, philosophy and economics of
  basic income and informs policymakers and practitioners about best practices
  in UBI experimentation.


  The purpose of the Basic Income Lab is to foster research and promote a more
  informed public discussion about basic income and its potential to alleviate
  poverty, precariousness and inequality.


  The Stanford Basic Income Lab was founded in February 2017 as an initiative of
  the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society. Under the leadership of
  Associate Professor Juliana Bidadanure and the support and guidance of Joan
  Berry, Executive Director of the McCoy Family Center of Ethics in Society, the
  Basic Income Lab received seed funding from the Economic Security Project and
  the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society to create an academic home for
  the study and evaluation of basic income experiments.

heading3: Why Basic Income?
body3: >-
  As automation, growing inequalities, increasing poverty, social precariousness
  and structural unemployment grow in relevance both in the United States and
  around the world, many experts have looked at alternative proposals to address
  these issues.


  From this debate, Universal Basic Income (UBI) has emerged as an interesting
  alternative to deal with some of the largest issues faced by the world today.


  Within this context, there is an increasing need for in-depth academic
  research on how to design, implement and evaluate UBI; what UBIâ€™s potential
  impacts could be; and, how feasible it would be to implement.
heading4: Why Here?
body4: >-
  In Silicon Valley, and increasingly in the United States, many individuals
  have expressed their support for Universal Basic Income due to a vast array of
  reasons. Some argue for it as providing a safety net for those who are already
  marginalized from the labor market; some support it as a measure to protect
  workers which may be displaced in the future due to increasing automation; and
  others defend it as a mechanism to provide real freedom to citizens.


  Stanford offers a unique set of interdisciplinary opportunities to further
  enhance the study of this proposal. Nestled in the heart of the bay area, the
  university excels in both engineering and the social sciences, providing BIL
  access to experts across disciplines to make contributions to UBI research.
