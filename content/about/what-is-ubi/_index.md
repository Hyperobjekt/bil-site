title: What Is UBI

herotext: >-
  Basic Income consists of a periodic cash allowance given to all citizens,
  without means test to provide them with a standard of living above the poverty
  line
heading1: What is Basic Income?
body1: >-
  Universal basic income takes on distinct forms in different historical and
  geographic contexts. It varies based on the funding proposal, the level of
  payment, the frequency of payment, and the particular policies proposed around
  it. Each of these parameters are fundamental, even if a range of versions
  still technically count as UBI (a universal, unconditional, individual,
  regular and cash payment).

  Basic Income.” Annual Review of Political Science 22, no. 1 (May 11, 2019):

  In recent years, UBI went from a utopian proposal to a policy with growing
  currency. UBI experiments have been conducted in countries as different as
  Kenya, Finland, Namibia, India, and Canada. In the United States, variants of
  the UBI proposal were very much alive in the early second half of the
  twentieth century—including through figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., and
  Milton Friedman—but the conversation did not pick up much in subsequent
  decades.


  This changed around 2016, when several American personalities wrote on the
  policy, including former Service Employees International Union president
  Andrew Stern, former Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich, and futurist Martin
  Ford. Notably, the technology incubator Y Combinator started testing UBI in
  Oakland, California, in 2016; the Economic Security Project was launched in
  2016, devoting millions of dollars to research and advocacy on UBI; and the
  mayor of Stockton, California, announced the launch of a pilot program,
  subsequently launched in March 2019. 


  The growth of income and wealth inequalities, the precariousness of labor, and
  the persistence of abject poverty have all been important drivers of renewed
  interest in UBI in the United States. But it is without a doubt the fear that
  automation may displace workers from the labor market at unprecedented rates
  that primarily explains the revival of the policy, including by many in or
  around Silicon Valley (Ford 2015). 


  UBI has a long history and has been defended from a variety of often
  overlapping, but occasionally conflicting, ideological perspectives. Like most
  proposals to expand the safety net, UBI has roots in social democratic,
  anarchist, and socialist thinking. Ancestors of UBI were discussed by the
  likes of Thomas Paine (1797) in the form of a lump sum granted to all citizens
  at adulthood, the Belgian socialist Joseph Charlier (1848) in the form of a
  “territorial dividend” generating a regular income, and James Meade \[1988
  (1935), 1993 (1964)] in the form of a “social dividend” in the 1930s and
  later. Those proposals share with recent versions of UBI a commitment to the
  view that a share of the wealth produced by all in common, or by previous
  generations, should be redistributed to all in the form of a direct payment to
  individuals. In a context of systemic discrimination against African-Americans
  and the resulting widespread unemployment and poverty, Martin Luther King, Jr.
  \[2010 (1967)], the Black Panther Party, and James Boggs (1968) also
  considered guaranteed income as a strategy. Meanwhile, feminists, including
  the Wages for Housework movement in the 1970s, also discussed an income
  separate from labor as a way to weaken the prominence of the male breadwinner
  model (Costa & James 1973, Cox & Federici 1976). UBI also has a footing in
  neoliberal thinking. The economist Milton Friedman famously defended a cousin
  of UBI, the Negative Income Tax (NIT). He held that the NIT would raise the
  floor without negatively affecting the price system and market mechanisms, and
  that it would reduce the paternalistic and intrusive state bureaucracy
  required to decide who, among the poor, merits assistance (Friedman 1962,
  1968).
heading3: Defining Characteristics
subhead3: >-
  Adapted from Bidadanure, 2019, "The Political Theory of Universal Basic
  Income"
item1head: Periodic
item1text: >-
  It is a recurrent payment (for example every month), rather than a one-off
  grant.
item2head: Cash payment
item2text: >-
  It is paid in cash, allowing the recipients to convert their benefits into
  whatever they may like.
item3head: Universal
item3text: 'It is paid to all, and not targeted to a specific population.'
item4head: Individual
item4text: It is paid on an individual basis (versus household-based).
item5head: Unconditional
item5text: >-
  It involves no work requirement or sanctions; it is accessible to those in
  work and out of work, voluntarily or not.
