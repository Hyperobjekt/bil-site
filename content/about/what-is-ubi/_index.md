heading1: What is Basic Income?
body1: >-
  The past three decades have seen the elaboration of a vast body of literature
  on universal basic income (UBI), a radical policy proposal Philippe Van Parijs
  referred to as "a disarmingly simple idea." It consists of a periodic cash
  allowance given to all citizens, without means test to provide them with a
  standard of living above the poverty line. Basic income crosses disciplinary
  and political lines - with activists, philosophers, economists, conservatives,
  and liberals arguing both for and against it, and sometimes changing their
  minds.


  Universal basic income takes different shapes depending on how it is framed,
  what policies are suggested to support it, the society in which it is applied,
  and how it is funded. Each of these variables are dependent on the proposal
  and are not necessarily defining features of the concept itself.


  On this page you will find the defining features of basic income, evidence
  collected thus far on the effects of cash-based grants, articles on basic
  income from a variety of disciplines, and literature on two popular
  alternatives to UBI—basic job guarantee and basic capital.
heading2: History of UBI
body2: >-
  Thomas More, Martin Luther King, Milton Friedman and various other figures in
  the fields of politics and economics considered UBI as a tool to change the
  world around them.


  The idea of a Basic Income first originated in the 15th century, when
  theologian Thomas More wrote Utopia and humanist Johannes Ludovicus Vives
  calculated a detailed scheme for a minimum income. In the following centuries,
  philosophers like Thomas Paine would support an equal pay for all citizens
  regardless of socioeconomic status. And in the twentieth century, the United
  States saw support for the idea from across the political spectrum. Reverend
  Martin Luther King Jr. argued in favor of a guaranteed income as the most
  effective means to eradicate poverty in the country while Economist and Nobel
  Laureate Milton Friedman proposed a negative income tax (an idea in many ways
  similar to a basic income).


  Stemming from an increased support for Friedman's proposal, the Nixon
  administration put forward a proposal for the Family Assistance Plan, a
  program that would have incorporated a guaranteed income with financial
  supplements for workers. Around the same time, negative income tax experiments
  would begin in the United States and Canada to explore the feasibility of what
  some. Notoriously, between 1974 and 1979 Canada would push a negative income
  tax experiment known as Mincome; between 1968 and 1982, the U.S. would carry
  out four income maintenance experiments in New Jersey, Gary, IN, Iowa, Seattle
  and Denver; and, in 1982, Alaska would create its Permanent Dividend Fund.
  Over the three years, experiments have appeared in cities like Jackson, MS;
  Santa Monica, CA; Chicago, IL; and in Stockton, CA and continue to be funded
  elsewhere in the United States.
