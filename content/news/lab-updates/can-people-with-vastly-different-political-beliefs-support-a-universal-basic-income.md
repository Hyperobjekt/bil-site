I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in philosophy at Stanford University and I have been involved with the Basic Income Lab since its beginning in 2017. My work at the Lab has focused on surveying the academic literature on the impact of basic income on gender justice, racial justice, and wellbeing. By reviewing the interdisciplinary literature on the impact of basic income on gender and racial justice, I sought to put into dialogue the normative and the empirical dimensions of this debate. ***My biggest takeaway from this work has been the realization that universal basic income (UBI) has a rare potential to gather supporters who hold vastly different beliefs and ideological commitments.***

One of the crucial challenges for contemporary democracies is to arrive at agreements over particular policies despite growing antagonisms and deep polarization across ideological lines. Drawing on a body of theoretical and empirical literature, I show that people holding vastly different political beliefs, illustrated through six theoretical frameworks of justice, have reasons to support the same policy: universal basic income. The table below provides an example of a policy that has the potential to yield such a consensus.
