*Olga Lenczewska, a fellow with the Stanford Basic Income Lab and 5th PhD student at Stanford looks at a how universal basic income (UBI) has a rare potential to gather supporters who hold vastly different beliefs and ideological commitments.*

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in philosophy at Stanford University and I have been involved with the Basic Income Lab since its beginning in 2017. My work at the Lab has focused on surveying the academic literature on the impact of basic income on gender justice, racial justice, and wellbeing. By reviewing the interdisciplinary literature on this topic, I sought to put into dialogue the normative and the empirical dimensions of this debate. ***My biggest takeaway from this work has been the realization that universal basic income (UBI) has a rare potential to gather supporters who hold vastly different beliefs and ideological commitments.***

One of the crucial challenges for contemporary democracies is to arrive at agreements over particular policies despite growing antagonisms and deep polarization across ideological lines. Drawing on a body of theoretical and empirical literature, I show that people holding vastly different political beliefs, illustrated through six theoretical frameworks of justice, have reasons to support the same policy: universal basic income. This table, **Supporting UBI from the Perspective of Different Frameworks of Justice,** describes how a UBI policy would be supported through different frameworks of justice. Some examples where there could be consensus on UBI include:

* Liberal egalitarians, left libertarians, republicans, and feminists would likely all support a basic income because of their shared concern for equity and empowerment within the household. As a benefit paid to the individual and not to the household, a UBI has the potential to empower economic dependents and secure them with exit options. The policy, if ongoing, could also provide a lifetime of financial security and bargaining power.
* Liberal egalitarians, left and right libertarians, republicans, and socialists may also support a basic income policy because of its universal and unconditional features which it would circumvent the paternalizing and demeaning process of means-testing.
* Republicans and socialists can also get behind UBI’s potential of freeing up time to allow people to spend more time on unpaid activities within their communities and thus promoting greater individual civic engagement.
* Finally, consensus around UBI may be generated to its potential to empower individuals – in the workplace (a reason shared by socialists, republicans, and left libertarians), in his/her/their ability to choose to work at all (a reason shared by liberal egalitarians and left libertarians), and in promoting an equal use of land resources (a reason shared by right and left libertarians).

Of course, having reasons to support this particular policy does not mean that this is the preferred policy for addressing some of the complex social and economic challenges of today. Different ideological groups might see UBI only as a second or third best solution to the problems they want to tackle. As such, while UBI may not be the first option policy for all to address issues of economic security, it may be one of the rare policies that individuals with differing political beliefs may be able to agree on in the end.
