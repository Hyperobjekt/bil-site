*Olga Lenczewska, a fellow with the Stanford Basic Income Lab and 5th PhD student at Stanford looks at a how universal basic income (UBI) has a rare potential to gather supporters who hold vastly different beliefs and ideological commitments.*

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in philosophy at Stanford University and I have been involved with the Basic Income Lab since its beginning in 2017. My work at the Lab has focused on surveying the academic literature on the impact of basic income on gender justice, racial justice, and wellbeing. By reviewing the interdisciplinary literature on this topic, I sought to put into dialogue the normative and the empirical dimensions of this debate. ***My biggest takeaway from this work has been the realization that universal basic income (UBI) has a rare potential to gather supporters who hold vastly different beliefs and ideological commitments.***

One of the crucial challenges for contemporary democracies is to arrive at agreements over particular policies despite growing antagonisms and deep polarization across ideological lines. Drawing on a body of theoretical and empirical literature, I show that people holding vastly different political beliefs, illustrated through six theoretical frameworks of justice, have reasons to support the same policy: universal basic income. This table, **[Supporting UBI from the Perspective of Different Frameworks of Justice](</papers/TABLE - SUPPORTING UBI FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DIFFERENT FRAMEWORKS OF JUSTICE.pdf>),** describes how a UBI policy would be supported through different frameworks of justice. Some examples where there could be consensus on UBI include:

* Liberal egalitarians, left libertarians, republicans, and feminists would likely all support a basic income because of their shared concern for equity and empowerment within the household. As a benefit paid to the individual and not to the household, a UBI has the potential to empower economic dependents and secure them with exit options. The policy, if ongoing, could also provide a lifetime of financial security and bargaining power.
* Liberal egalitarians, left and right libertarians, republicans, and socialists may also support a basic income policy because of its universal and unconditional features which it would circumvent the paternalizing and demeaning process of means-testing.
* Republicans and socialists can also get behind UBI’s potential of freeing up time to allow people to spend more time on unpaid activities within their communities and thus promoting greater individual civic engagement.
* Finally, consensus around UBI may be generated to its potential to empower individuals – in the workplace (a reason shared by socialists, republicans, and left libertarians), in his/her/their ability to choose to work at all (a reason shared by liberal egalitarians and left libertarians), and in promoting an equal use of land resources (a reason shared by right and left libertarians).

Of course, having reasons to support this particular policy does not mean that this is the preferred policy for addressing some of the complex social and economic challenges of today. Different ideological groups might see UBI only as a second or third best solution to the problems they want to tackle. As such, while UBI may not be the first option policy for all to address issues of economic security, it may be one of the rare policies that individuals with differing political beliefs may be able to agree on in the end.

##### Liberal egalitarianism

Liberal egalitarianism, most commonly associated with the work of John Rawls, is concerned with reconciling the value of equality with the value of liberty, which jointly embed the idea of justice as impartiality. The liberal egalitarian emphasis on liberty can be understood as striving to ensure that everybody has the freedom to develop and pursue their own conception of the good life. The value of equality is also essential and corresponds to the liberal commitment to supporting individual choices regardless of their preferences. Such respect is considered to be incompatible with very large socio-economic inequalities. Rawls has famously unified these values in his two fundamental Principles of Justice. The First Principle gives everyone equal right to a scheme of basic liberties compatible with the same liberties for others. The Second Principle specifies that socio-economic inequalities must be arranged to everyone’s advantage and that everyone must compete for jobs and other positions on equal terms.

**Empowerment within the household**

As a benefit paid to the individual and not to the household, UBI could go a long way in empowering economic dependentsand providing them with exit options(for example,in cases of domestic abuse).(Van Parijs 1995;Zelleke 2014)

**Neutrality of preferences**

UBI grants individualsmore freedom in determining life choices byproviding a lifetimeoffinancial security regardless of one’s career preferences.It would thus support individualsindevelopingand pursuingtheir own conception of happiness.(Van Parijs 1995;Zelleke 2014)

**Non-demeaning welfare**

Because it is unconditional and universal, UBI avoids the paternalizing, demeaning, and stigmatizing process of means-testing, which iscentral tomost of the current welfare schemes. (Zelleke 2014)

**Poverty elimination**

UBI has the potential to eliminate absolute poverty–povertywhich is incompatible in the most basic sense with individual freedom. (Van Parijs 1995; Zelleke 2014)

**Education / Acquisition of skills**

UBI would allow individuals to access opportunities for additional education and re-training. Such opportunities could give people material and intellectual resources topursue the kind of projects they want to. (Zelleke 2014)

**The right not to work**

Wealthy countries have a humanitarian duty, or a duty of justice,to satisfy the basic needs of their citizens even when they choose to engage in non-waged kinds of work. UBI could be a good way for countries enjoying productive economies to discharge this duty.(Baker 1992)

##### Left/real libertarianism

Libertarians endorse a theory of natural (pre-political) rights, including the right against coercion, the right to self-ownership, and the right to private property. Left
libertarians in particular are additionally primarily concerned with providing everybody, including the least well-off, with a large degree of freedom from external constraints
(such as scarcity of basic resources or an abusive work contract). They believe that this requires a certain measure of redistribution to ensure all individuals can adequately
own themselves. Left libertarians also generally believe in the right to an equal share of natural resources: the “Lockean proviso” according to which all individuals have an
equal right to the natural resources necessary for subsistence. Mixing one’s labor, over which one has full self-ownership, with natural resources usually yields in one’s right
to private property.

**Empowerment within the household**

As a benefit paid to the individual and not to the household, UBI could go a long way in empowering economic dependents and providing them with exit options (for example, in cases
of domestic abuse). (Van Parijs 1991, 1995)

**Neutrality of preferences**

UBI respects the autonomy and agency of individuals by providing them with financial means to satisfy their own needs without being coerced into a particular labor-intensive lifestyle. (Van Parijs 1991; Moseley 2011; Henderson 2017)

**Non-demeaning welfare**

Because it is unconditional and universal, UBI avoids the paternalizing, demeaning, and stigmatizing process of means- testing, which is central to most of the current welfare schemes. (Van Parijs 1991, 1995; Zwolinski 2015)

**Poverty elimination**

UBI has the potential to eliminate absolute poverty and to guarantee basic subsistence for every individual. (Van Parijs 1991, 1995; Zwolinski 2015)

**Empowerment within the workplace**

A workplace should be free from external constraints to pursuing a satisfying career path, such as poor working conditions, an abusive employment contract, or lack of sufficient leisure time. UBI could empower workers by removing such external
constraints. (Van Parijs 1991, 1995)

**The right not to work**

Differences among people’s occupational needs and preferences should be respected through a system of free choice of occupation, including the right not to work at all. UBI could help sustain those who choose to exercise this right. (Van Parijs 1991, 1995)

**Equal world-ownership**

UBI could help promote the right to equal world-ownership and to an equal use of land resources. (Moseley 2011; Vallentyne 2012; Zwolinski 2015)

##### Right libertarianism

Libertarians endorse a theory of natural (pre-political) rights, including the right against coercion, the right to self-ownership, and the right to private property. In addition, philosophers commitment to right libertarianism (most prominently Nozick) emphasize the normative priority of individual freedom and advocate for a small state with minimal intervention in private and market-based interactions. The sole function of such a state would be the specification, interpretation, and enforcement of negative individual rights through the military, police, and court system. Right libertarians generally reject the non-consensual taxation of labor and the products of labor. They share ties with neoliberalism as an economic doctrine.

**Efficiency of welfare**

Welfare distribution is often
inefficient and ineffective as it
relies on a large bureaucracy of
control. A universal cash
transfer would remove
