Since 2018, the Stanford Basic Income Lab has been engaged in a thorough review of the UBI literature by theme and subtheme with the aim of presenting the research in a more methodic and user-friendly platform. Led by the Lab's Faculty Director, Juliana Bidadanure, and the Lab's Program Manager, Sarah Berger Gonzalez, the research visualization aims to present existing empirical facts and data around UBI and the broad value-based questions and arguments that surround UBI along critical themes like gender, race and health. 

As new research sheds light on a basic income policy, the Lab will be adding additional themes and subthemes and adding new information to the existing research.
