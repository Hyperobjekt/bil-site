##### Liberal egalitarianism

Liberal egalitarianism, most commonly associated with the work of John Rawls, is concerned with reconciling the value of equality with the value of liberty, which jointly embed the idea of justice as impartiality. The liberal egalitarian emphasis on liberty can be understood as striving to ensure that everybody has the freedom to develop and pursue their own conception of the good life. The value of equality is also essential and corresponds to the liberal commitment to supporting individual choices regardless of their preferences. Such respect is considered to be incompatible with very large socio-economic inequalities. Rawls has famously unified these values in his two fundamental Principles of Justice. The First Principle gives everyone equal right to a scheme of basic liberties compatible with the same liberties for others. The Second Principle specifies that socio-economic inequalities must be arranged to everyone’s advantage and that everyone must compete for jobs and other positions on equal terms.

**Empowerment within the household**

As a benefit paid to the individual and not to the household, UBI could go a long way in empowering economic dependentsand providing them with exit options(for example,in cases of domestic abuse).(Van Parijs 1995;Zelleke 2014)

**Neutrality of preferences**

UBI grants individualsmore freedom in determining life choices byproviding a lifetimeoffinancial security regardless of one’s career preferences.It would thus support individualsindevelopingand pursuingtheir own conception of happiness.(Van Parijs 1995;Zelleke 2014)

**Non-demeaning welfare**

Because it is unconditional and universal, UBI avoids the paternalizing, demeaning, and stigmatizing process of means-testing, which iscentral tomost of the current welfare schemes. (Zelleke 2014)

**Poverty elimination**

UBI has the potential to eliminate absolute poverty–povertywhich is incompatible in the most basic sense with individual freedom. (Van Parijs 1995; Zelleke 2014)

**Education / Acquisition of skills**

UBI would allow individuals to access opportunities for additional education and re-training. Such opportunities could give people material and intellectual resources topursue the kind of projects they want to. (Zelleke 2014)

**The right not to work**

Wealthy countries have a humanitarian duty, or a duty of justice,to satisfy the basic needs of their citizens even when they choose to engage in non-waged kinds of work. UBI could be a good way for countries enjoying productive economies to discharge this duty.(Baker 1992)

##### Left/real libertarianism

Libertarians endorse a theory of natural (pre-political) rights, including the right against coercion, the right to self-ownership, and the right to private property. Left
libertarians in particular are additionally primarily concerned with providing everybody, including the least well-off, with a large degree of freedom from external constraints
(such as scarcity of basic resources or an abusive work contract). They believe that this requires a certain measure of redistribution to ensure all individuals can adequately
own themselves. Left libertarians also generally believe in the right to an equal share of natural resources: the “Lockean proviso” according to which all individuals have an
equal right to the natural resources necessary for subsistence. Mixing one’s labor, over which one has full self-ownership, with natural resources usually yields in one’s right
to private property.

**Empowerment within the household**

As a benefit paid to the individual and not to the household, UBI could go a long way in empowering economic dependents and providing them with exit options (for example, in cases
of domestic abuse). (Van Parijs 1991, 1995)

**Neutrality of preferences**

UBI respects the autonomy and agency of individuals by providing them with financial means to satisfy their own needs without being coerced into a particular labor-intensive lifestyle. (Van Parijs 1991; Moseley 2011; Henderson 2017)

**Non-demeaning welfare**

Because it is unconditional and universal, UBI avoids the paternalizing, demeaning, and stigmatizing process of means- testing, which is central to most of the current welfare schemes. (Van Parijs 1991, 1995; Zwolinski 2015)

**Poverty elimination**

UBI has the potential to eliminate absolute poverty and to guarantee basic subsistence for every individual. (Van Parijs 1991, 1995; Zwolinski 2015)

**Empowerment within the workplace**

A workplace should be free from external constraints to pursuing a satisfying career path, such as poor working conditions, an abusive employment contract, or lack of sufficient leisure time. UBI could empower workers by removing such external
constraints. (Van Parijs 1991, 1995)

**The right not to work**

Differences among people’s occupational needs and preferences should be respected through a system of free choice of occupation, including the right not to work at all. UBI could help sustain those who choose to exercise this right. (Van Parijs 1991, 1995)

**Equal world-ownership**

UBI could help promote the right to equal world-ownership and to an equal use of land resources. (Moseley 2011; Vallentyne 2012; Zwolinski 2015)

##### Right libertarianism

Libertarians endorse a theory of natural (pre-political) rights, including the right against coercion, the right to self-ownership, and the right to private property. In addition, philosophers commitment to right libertarianism (most prominently Nozick) emphasize the normative priority of individual freedom and advocate for a small state with minimal intervention in private and market-based interactions. The sole function of such a state would be the specification, interpretation, and enforcement of negative individual rights through the military, police, and court system. Right libertarians generally reject the non-consensual taxation of labor and the products of labor. They share ties with neoliberalism as an economic doctrine.

**Efficiency of welfare**

Welfare distribution is often
inefficient and ineffective as it
relies on a large bureaucracy of
control. A universal cash
transfer would remove the
need for a large bureaucracy
and promote a more efficient
distribution of benefits.
(Zwolinski 2010; Munger 2012)

**Neutrality of preferences**

UBI respects the autonomy and
agency of individuals by
providing them with financial
means to satisfy their own
needs without being coerced
into a particular labor-intensive
lifestyle. (Munger 2012)

**Non-demeaning welfare**

Because it is unconditional and
universal, UBI avoids the
paternalizing, demeaning, and
stigmatizing process of meanstesting, which is central to
most of the current welfare
schemes. (Munger 2012)

**Equal world-ownership**

UBI could help promote the
right to equal world-ownership
and to an equal use of land
resources. (Munger 2012)

##### Republicanism

Republicans (notably Pettit) are concerned with the idea of freedom from domination – the absence of dominating control or the condition of not being subject to the
arbitrary or uncontrolled power of others. Republicans understand the idea of dominating control as a hierarchical mechanism whereby one individual or institution can
exercise arbitrary power and control over another individual. Another value central for the republican political thought is civic virtue: the formation of a virtuous character
that demonstrates a dedication to the wellbeing of one’s community and active political participation. Civic virtue is supposed to be influenced and shaped by public
institutions and by public policies designed to deliberately cultivate it.

**Empowerment within the household**

As a benefit paid to the
individual and not to the
household, UBI could go a
long way in empowering
economic dependents and
protecting them from the
potential dominating control
of other members of their
household. (Pettit 2007)

**Neutrality of preferences**

UBI would promote freedom
from domination by reducing
the power of employers and
over individuals’ economic
lives. This is because UBI
could boost bargaining power,
exit options, and power to say
no to exploitative contracts.
(Pettit 2007, Widerquist 2013)

**Non-demeaning welfare**

Because it is unconditional and
universal, UBI avoids the
paternalizing, demeaning, and
stigmatizing process of meanstesting, which is central to
most of the current welfare
schemes. (Pettit 2007)

**Community participation**

UBI could allow people to
spend more time on unpaid
activities within their
communities and thus help
promote a model of
individuals as public citizens
participating in the public
sphere and being involved in
various democratic practices.
(Dagger 2006; White 2007)

**Empowerment within the workplace**

Workers should be free from
the domination of their bosses,
which can manifest itself
through a precarious
employment contract or
unregulated working hours.
UBI could provide workers
with more freedom from nondomination. (Pettit 2007)

##### Marxism/socialism

One of Karl Marx’s original criticisms of capitalism is the exploitation of wage laborers: the logic of capitalist production dictates that the only potential source of profit is
found in the gap between the value produced by the workers and the wage they received for their labor. Capitalism thus necessitates the exploitation of workers and their
subjection to the arbitrary power of wealth over which they have no ownership. As a result, workers experience exploitation and a growing sense of alienation from their
labor, from the product of their labor, and from having meaningful connections with other people. Contemporary Marxist and socialist political thought emphasizes the
importance of collective bargaining and organized labor; the need to reduce the asymmetry between employers and employees; the need for a workplace with decent
working conditions and opportunities for growth; the importance of recognizing the value of informal work and community engagement; and the workers’ right to be
protected from the political or technological changes in the labor market.

**Offsetting automation effects**

UBI could help protect workers
from the growing unemployment
and labor displacement, which
continuous technological
advancements and automatization
are likely to cause. (Rogers 2017)

**Community participation**

UBI could allow people to spend
more time on unpaid activities
within their communities and thus
help promote a model of
individuals as public citizens
participating in the public sphere
and being involved in various
democratic practices. (Wright 2006)

**Non-demeaning welfare**

Because it is unconditional and
universal, UBI avoids the
paternalizing, demeaning, and
stigmatizing process of meanstesting, which is central to most of
the current welfare schemes.
(Wright 2006)

**Poverty elimination**

UBI has the potential to eliminate
absolute poverty and to guarantee
basic subsistence for every
individual. (Rogers 2017)

**Empowerment within the workplace**

A workplace should have decent
working conditions, provide
opportunities for leisure time and
exit options, and develop the
capacities and talents of these
employees. UBI could empower
workers in these ways. (Van der
Veen & Van Parijs 1986; Wright
2006; Gourevich 2016)

##### Feminism

Feminist political thought has been centered on the need for gender equity understood as equal political, educational, and career opportunities for men and women and,
relatedly, the importance of empowering women across economic, political, and social spheres. One key concern has been the recognition of the value of care work and
housework, including the need to distribute the burdens of such work more equitably within the household. According to the ethics of care – an ethical theory founded on
feminist thought – moral action further centers around intimate caring relationships between individuals. Contemporary feminist political thinkers advocate for the
empowerment of economically dependent spouses, the need for affordable daycare and longer parental leaves, and an adequate recognition and compensation of informal
labor. They also emphasize the distinctiveness of the experiences and struggles of women and other gender minorities who are multiply burdened because they find
themselves at the intersection of numerous axes of oppression.

**Empowerment within the household**
As a benefit paid to the
individual and not to the
household, UBI could go a
long way in empowering
economic dependents and
providing them with exit
options (for example, in cases
of domestic abuse). (Robeyns
2001; Pateman 2004; McKay
2007)

**Neutrality of preferences**

UBI grants individuals more
freedom in determining life
choices by providing a
lifetime of financial security
regardless of one’s career
preferences. It could
potentially free women from
the traditional roles they have
assumed, allowing them to
develop and pursue their own
conception of happiness.
(McKay 2007; Zelleke 2008)

**Recognition of care work**

Gender equity requires a
more adequate recognition
and compensation of care
work and housework. UBI
could help further this goal by
increasing the economic
security of unwaged
caregivers and detaching
income from employment.
(Robeyns 2001)

**Poverty elimination**

UBI has the potential to
eliminate absolute poverty*
and thus to satisfy most of
our basic needs. (Zelleke
2008)

**Family time**

Everyone should be able to
spend as much quality time
with their loved ones and
dependents as they want to,
but these prospects are often
incompatible with our
breadwinner economic
model. UBI could support all
individuals (regardless of
gender) in reducing work
hours to care for dependents.
(Pateman 2004; McKay 2007)
