Some skeptics of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) object to the policy proposal’s component of unconditionality on the grounds of potential exploitation of net payers by net beneficiaries of a UBI. This talk argues that gender inequalities of power and resources, which are largely (but not solely), the result of women’s disproportionate responsibility for care work, must be explicitly highlighted in the argument for the unconditional component of a UBI. It further discusses how each of the components of a UBI--universality, individuality, and unconditionality--can contribute to the redistribution of assets, power, and care work that are central to reducing gender inequality. 

After her talk, Almaz will be in conversation with Myra Strober (Professor Emerita, School of Education, Stanford)
