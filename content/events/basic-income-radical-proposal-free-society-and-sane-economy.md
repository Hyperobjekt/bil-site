Philippe Van Parijs will present on his new book, co-written with Yannick Vanderborght, in which the authors offer the most comprehensive defense of basic income, advocating it as our most realistic hope for addressing economic insecurity and social exclusion in the twenty-first century.

He is one of the founders of the Basic Income Earth Network and chairs its International Board. His books include _Real Freedom for All. What (if anything) Can Justify Capitalism?_ (Oxford UP, 1995), _What's Wrong with a Free Lunch?_ (Beacon Press, 2001), _Just Democracy_. _The Rawls-Machiavelli Programme_ (ECPR, 2011) , _Linguistic Justice for Europe and for the World_ (Oxford UP, 2011) and _Basic Income: A radical proposal for a free society and a sane economy_ (Harvard UP, 2017, with Y.
