Cities and Universal Basic Income is hosted by the Stanford Basic Income Lab, in partnership with the National League of Cities, the Economic Security Project, and the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society.

This event will bring together city leaders, international experimenters, researchers, and funders to substantially advance the discussion on the suitability of basic income in addressing poverty and exclusion in American cities.

We aim to:

- Share the current state of city, state/province and country-level basic income experiments around the world

- Equip U.S. city leaders to consider a continuum of basic income options (EITC, childfocused, etc.) concentrated on strengthening the economic security of their residents

- Engage prominent researchers and philanthropic leaders to identify new areas of research to support city-level basic income experiment

- Foster a productive discussion from a variety of different perspectives on how the goal of economic security can be best achieved at the city level.
