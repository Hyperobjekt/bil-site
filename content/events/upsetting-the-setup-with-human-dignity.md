**Michael Tubbs** is a leading voice for guaranteed income in the United States. As the former mayor of Stockton, California, Tubbs launched the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration in 2019 – the country's first city-led guaranteed income experiment. In addition, Tubbs is the founder of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, a coalition of U.S. mayors advocating for a guaranteed income at the local, state, and federal level. He now serves as the special adviser for economic mobility and opportunity to Gov. Gavin Newsom. 

**Aisha Nyandoro**, the founding chief executive officer of [Springboard To Opportunities](https://springboardto.org/about/leadership/), will moderate the conversation. As CEO, Nyandoro uses a “radically resident-driven” approach to end generational poverty. She launched the very first of its kind guaranteed income program for single Black mothers in the history of the United States – The Magnolia Mother’s Trust.  

This event is co-sponsored by the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society and the Stanford Basic Income Lab.
