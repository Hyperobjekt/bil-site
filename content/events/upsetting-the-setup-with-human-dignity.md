**Michael Tubbs** is a leading voice for guaranteed income in the United States. As the former mayor of Stockton, California, Tubbs launched the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration in 2019 – the country's first city-led guaranteed income experiment. In addition, Tubbs is the founder of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, a coalition of U.S. mayors advocating for a guaranteed income at the local, state, and federal level. He now serves as the special adviser for economic mobility and opportunity to Gov. Gavin Newsom. 

Tubbs will be in conversation with **Aisha Nyandoro**, the founding chief executive officer of [Springboard To Opportunities](https://springboardto.org/about/leadership/). As CEO, Nyandoro uses a “radically resident-driven” approach to end generational poverty. She launched the very first of its kind guaranteed income program for single Black mothers in the history of the United States – The Magnolia Mother’s Trust.
