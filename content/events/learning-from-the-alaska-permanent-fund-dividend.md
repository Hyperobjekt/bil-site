On September 21, 2019, the Basic Income Lab hosted an all-day event to discuss the current state of the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD). The event convened policymakers, practitioners and academics from across the U.S. Given the prominence that the Alaska PFD has had in the discussion around basic income, the event provided an overview of the PFD, its history, its current impacts and policy challenges.

A white paper _(forthcoming)_ will draw on the presentations and discussion to highlight features of the Alaska PFD and policy lessons learned over the years and to offer recommendations and questions to consider for future basic income experiments and policies.
