On September 21, 2019, the Basic Income Lab brought together policymakers, practitioners and researchers to learn about and discuss the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD). Given the prominence that the Alaska PFD has played in the discussion around basic income, the event aimed to provide an overview of the PFD, its history, its current impacts and policy challenges, it's fiscal sustainability and proposed changes to the design of dividend.

A white paper _(forthcoming)_ will highlight features of the Alaska PFD, policy lessons learned over the years and possible recommendations and questions to consider for future basic income experiments and policies.
