Join us for a conversation with Annie Lowrey, an economics writer and author of "Give People Money: How a Universal Basic Income Would End Poverty, Revolutionize Work, and Remake the World." The book examines the concept of a universal basic income (UBI) and why a stipend given to every citizen might be necessary in an age of rising inequality, persistent poverty and dazzling technology.

The book also explores the potential of such a sweeping policy and the challenges the movement faces, among them contradictory aims, uncomfortable costs, and, most powerfully, the entrenched belief that no one should get something for nothing.

Lowrey is a contributing editor for The Atlantic and previously wrote for The New York Times and its magazine. Her talk is presented by Stanfordâ€™s Basic Income Lab at the <a href="https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society</a>.

Seating will be on a first-come basis, but we would appreciate your RSVP to help with planning purposes. If you are unable to RSVP, we encourage you to attend anyway. We'll do our best to accommodate everyone!
