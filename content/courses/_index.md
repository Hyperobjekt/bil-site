  Among the various objections to UBI, one concern its moral adequacy: Isn't it
  fundamentally unjust to give cash to all indiscriminately rather than to those
  who need it and deserve it? Over the years, a variety of scholars have
  defended the policy on moral grounds, arguing that UBI is a tool of equality,
  liberal freedom, republican freedom, gender equity, or racial equity. Many
  others have attacked UBI on those very same grounds, making the case that
  alternative policy proposals like the job guarantee, means-tested benefits,
  conditional benefits, or reparations should be preferred. In this class,
  students will learn about political theory and ethics through the specific
  angle of the policy proposal, and they will develop an expertise on the
  philosophy, politics and economics of UBI. 


  The seminar is open to undergraduate and graduate students in all departments.
  There are no pre-requisites.

  We will ask questions such as: is giving people cash no strings attached
  desirable and just? Would basic income promote a more gender equal society
  through the remuneration of care-work, or would it risks further entrenching
  the position of women as care-givers? Would alternative policies be more
  successful (such as the job guarantees, stakeholder grants or a negative
  income tax)? How can we test out basic income? What makes for a reliable and
  ethical basic income pilot? Students in Politics, Philosophy, Public Policy,
  Social Work, and Sociology should find most of those questions relevant to
  their interests. Some discussions on how to fund basic income, on the
  macro-economic implications of basic income and on the existing pilots
  projects (in Finland, Namibia, India, Canada and the US) may be of interest to
  Economists; while our readings on the impact of new technologies and
  artificial intelligence on the future of work and whether a basic income could
  be a solution, are likely to be on interest to computer scientists and
  engineers.
