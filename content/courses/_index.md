  The past three decades have seen the elaboration of a vast body of literature
  on unconditional basic income a radical policy proposal Philippe Van Parijs
  referred to as a disarmingly simple idea. It consists of a monthly cash
  allowance given to all citizens, regardless of personal desert and without
  means test to provide them with a standard of living above the poverty line
  ...


  The seminar will seek to engage students in normative debates in political
  theory (feminism, liberalism, republicanism, communism, libertarianism, etc.)
  by appealing to the concrete example of basic income. It will allow students
  to learn a great deal about a policy that is gaining tremendous currency in
  academic and public debates, while discussing and learning about prominent
  political theorists - many of whom have written against or for basic income at
  one point in their career. The seminar is open to undergraduate and graduate
  students in all departments. There are no pre-requisites.

  We will ask questions such as: is giving people cash no strings attached
  desirable and just? Would basic income promote a more gender equal society
  through the remuneration of care-work, or would it risks further entrenching
  the position of women as care-givers? Would alternative policies be more
  successful (such as the job guarantees, stakeholder grants or a negative
  income tax)? How can we test out basic income? What makes for a reliable and
  ethical basic income pilot? Students in Politics, Philosophy, Public Policy,
  Social Work, and Sociology should find most of those questions relevant to
  their interests. Some discussions on how to fund basic income, on the
  macro-economic implications of basic income and on the existing pilots
  projects (in Finland, Namibia, India, Canada and the US) may be of interest to
  Economists; while our readings on the impact of new technologies and
  artificial intelligence on the future of work and whether a basic income could
  be a solution, are likely to be on interest to computer scientists and
  engineers.


  By the end of the class, students will have an in depth knowledge of the
  policy and will have developed skills in the normative analysis of public
  policy. They will be able to deploy those critical and analytical skills to
  assess a broad range of other policies.
