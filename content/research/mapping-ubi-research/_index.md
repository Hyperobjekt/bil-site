  The UBI Research Visualization bolsters basic income research by presenting
  existing knowledge in an accessible platform organized across multiple themes
  and subthemes. It presents comprehensive summaries of articles, research
  papers, and books produced on UBI to date; enables viewers to see the
  diversity of approaches that have been taken on testing UBI and related
  policies; and allows users to get a good sense of the key tenets of the
  debate. The user-friendly platform aspires to provide a wide variety of
  stakeholders (researchers and students, experimenters, policymakers and
  philanthropic organizations, among others) with just-in-time access to UBI
  research. It is the result of two years of research led by the Faculty
  Director and Program Manager and carried out by a large team of Lab fellows
  since 2018. Central to the extensive summaries presented below is the
  commitment to bridging the gap between facts and values. The summaries present
  existing empirical facts and data around UBI and the broad value-based
  questions and arguments that surround UBI along critical themes like gender,
  race and health.

heading2: Coming Summer 2020
body2: Currently in development, this interactive network visualization will
  serve as the first-ever online platform for exploring existing research on
  Basic Income.
