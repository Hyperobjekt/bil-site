body1: >-
  Despite the growing UBI research effort over the past 30 years, there does not exist an online tool that conveniently brings together the existing research in one place. The Basic Income Lab is working to develop the first such visualization, thus promoting more methodical progress in the academic field of UBI, and building a rigorous platform for the benefit of future basic-income experimenters, researchers, students, and policy-makers.


  The online platform will provide pertinent summaries of articles, research papers, books produced on UBI to date, highlighting important findings from each and ensuring that core areas such as health, crime, stigma, childhood poverty and gender equity are covered.


  In Spring 2020, we will unveil the finished platform at a large-scale event.
  Stay tuned for more updates on our progress!
