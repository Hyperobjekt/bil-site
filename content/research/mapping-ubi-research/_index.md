heading1: Mapping UBI Research
body1: >-
  Despite the growing UBI research effort over the past 30 years, there does not
  exist an online tool that conveniently brings together the existing research
  in one place. The Basic Income Lab is working to develop the first such
  visualization, thus promoting more methodical progress in the academic field
  of UBI, and building a rigorous platform for the benefit of future
  basic-income experimenters, researchers, students, and policy-makers. TEST


  The online platform will provide pertinent summaries of articles, research
  papers, books produced on UBI to date, highlighting important findings from
  each and ensuring that core areas such as health, crime, stigma, childhood
  poverty and gender equity are covered.


  To construct this platform, our team of four Stanford graduate researchers
  started reviewing the UBI scholarship in January 2018 through an
  interdisciplinary lens. Specifically, an economics student surveyed past and
  current UBI experiments; two political theorists are surveying the conceptual
  and normative literature on UBI; and a computer scientist is helping us design
  the online platform and city toolkit in collaboration with a data
  visualization team.


  In 2019, we will unveil the finished platform at a large-scale event. Stay
  tuned for more updates on our progress!

  Currently in development, this interactive network visualization will serve as
  the first-ever online platform for exploring existing research on Basic
  Income.
