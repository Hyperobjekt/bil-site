  Welcome to the Lab’s UBI Research Visualization! 
  
  
  
  The UBI Research Visualization bolsters basic income research through presenting existing knowledge on UBI in an accessible platform organized across multiple themes and subthemes to understand the potential impact of UBI in supporting healthier communities. The Visualization presents comprehensive summaries of articles, research papers, and books produced on UBI to date; enables viewers to see the diversity of approaches that have been taken on testing UBI and related policies; and allows users to get a good sense of the key tenets of the debate. 
  
  
  The user-friendly platform also aspires to provide a wide variety of stakeholders (researchers and students, experimenters, policymakers and philanthropic organizations, among others) with just-in-time access to UBI research and to promote more methodical research progress in the field.  
  
  
  The Research Visualization is the result of two years of research led by the Faculty Director and Program Manager and carried out by a large team of Lab fellows. Since 2018, the BIL team has been working diligently to develop this tool that conveniently presents the state of knowledge on UBI: what problems a UBI policy can tackle, what ways a UBI policy may be limited, what is known about what UBI can do, and what questions remain unanswered. Central to the comprehensive summaries presented below is the commitment to bridging the gap between facts and values. The summaries present existing empirical facts and data around UBI and the broad value-based questions and arguments that surround UBI along critical themes like gender, race and health.

heading2: Coming Summer 2020
body2: Currently in development, this interactive network visualization will
  serve as the first-ever online platform for exploring existing research on
  Basic Income.
