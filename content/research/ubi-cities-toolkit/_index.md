body1: >-
  Launched in early November 2018 at the National League of Cities annual
  meeting, the toolkit, Basic Income In Cities: A Guide to City Experiments and
  Pilot Projects, highlights emerging practices and shares insights on the
  process of designing UBI experiments in ways that are ethical, rigorous,
  informative and consequential for local and national policymaking.


  The toolkit is in part the outcome of a UBI cities workshop convened by the
  Basic Income Lab in partnership with the National League of Cities (NLC) and
  the Economic Security Project in September 2017. Researchers and key
  stakeholders from the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, the Y
  Combinator’s Basic Income Project, the Universal Income Project and the Jain
  Family Institute also made valuable contributions.
