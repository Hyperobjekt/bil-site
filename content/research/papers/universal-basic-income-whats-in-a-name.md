excerpt: >-
  In continuation of the Lab’s effort to illuminate best practices for the
  design of a basic income policy, the Stanford Basic Income Lab held an all-day
  workshop on March 6, 2020—called 

  “What’s in a Name?”—that examined the variety of names that have been given to Universal Basic Income and related policies. This white paper provides a summary of the discussions that occurred at the workshop and offers several findings that we hope can inform future basic income projects.

abstract: This paper examines what names can be given to the proposal and pilots
  and whether a single name across programs is needed to develop the proposal
  into an implementable policy. The question, What’s in a name? generates a far
  from straightforward answer. A multi-disciplinary approach, though, reveals a
  variety of important parameters for consideration. Moreover, the variety of
  values called upon by experimenters to name pilots is an asset to the growing
  movement, since it attests to the richness of the deep commitments (e.g.,
  equity, dignity, respect, trust and abundance) underpinning UBI. While
  recognizing this richness, however, this paper cautions about the use of too
  many names to refer to UBI at the policy level, pointing out that doing so
  creates significant definitional ambiguities about key features of the policy
  (notably its universal, individual and unconditional features). Employing a
  single name to refer to the proposal could be critical for advancing the
  policy at the national and international level.
