    Launched in early November 2018 at the National League of Cities annual meeting, the toolkit, Basic Income In Cities: A Guide to City Experiments and Pilot Projects, highlights emerging practices and shares insights on the process of designing UBI experiments in ways that are ethical, rigorous, informative and consequential for local and national policymaking.


    The toolkit is in part the outcome of a UBI cities workshop convened by the Basic Income Lab in partnership with the National League of Cities (NLC) and the Economic Security Project in September 2017. Researchers and key stakeholders from the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, the Y Combinatorâ€™s Basic Income Project, the Universal Income Project and the Jain Family Institute also made valuable contributions.
