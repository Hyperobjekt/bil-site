excerpt: What new services might open in a community when the people who live
  there have a secure economic base? What types of jobs are created when
  individuals have increased bargaining power? What types of governance
  processes emerge when individuals all receive the same support? This report
  examines how a healthy communities lens can address unanswered questions about
  UBI.

abstract: >-
  There is a shift in some fields towards thinking about health and wellbeing
  through the framework of healthy communities. But, so far, attention to the
  community effects of income transfers has been more limited in policy and
  research debates surrounding UBI, and no review has focussed exclusively on
  these impacts.


  A 'healthy communities' approach can refocus UBI as not merely an individual matter, but as explicitly connected to the fabric where people live out their daily lives. This report takes a closer look at what evidence exists for community-wide effects and examines how a healthy community lens can address unanswered questions about UBI, and how a focus on community-level outcomes could inform some core policy debates. The report concludes with  a 'healthy communities' agenda for UBI.
