excerpt: In the last ten years, as Universal Basic Income has moved up the
  policy agenda, many reviews and reports have taken stock of the evidence on
  unconditional and universal cash programs. Our report, “A cross synthesis of
  recent reviews of the evidence on UBI-type programs,” is intended as an
  "umbrella review."

abstract: In the last ten years, as Universal Basic Income has moved up the
  policy agenda, many reviews and reports have taken stock of the evidence on
  unconditional and universal cash programs. Our report, “A cross synthesis of
  recent reviews of the evidence on UBI-type programs,” is intended as an
  ‘umbrella review’—it provides a roadmap to the literature for experimenters,
  policy practitioners, policymakers and others involved in UBI development and
  implementation. This report compiles and critically examines 16 reviews of the
  evidence in order to synthesize key findings, identify evidence gaps, and
  derive directions for future UBI research, policy and practice.
