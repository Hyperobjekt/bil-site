abstract: In the last ten years, as Universal Basic Income has moved up the policy agenda, many reviews and reports have taken stock of the evidence on unconditional and universal cash programs. Our report, “A cross synthesis of recent reviews of the evidence on UBI-type programs,” is intended as an ‘umbrella review’—it provides a roadmap to the literature for experimenters, policy practitioners, policymakers and others involved in UBI development and implementation. This report compiles and critically examines 16 reviews of the evidence in order to synthesize key findings, identify evidence gaps, and derive directions for future UBI research, policy and practice.
