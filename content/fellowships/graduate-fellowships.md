**Overview:**

The Stanford Basic Income Lab is seeking to recruit up to two graduate students to assist with an extensive review and mapping of research on Universal Basic Income (UBI). The ideal candidate will be trained in Politics, Sociology, Public Policy, or Economics (and related fields) and have a strong interest in learning more about UBI. â€¨To be considered, please send your CV and a short cover letter to Sarah Berger Gonzalez, Program Manager of the Stanford Basic Income Lab, at basicincomelab@stanford.edu.

The research project, described below, is already underway but will be ongoing as new literature results from current experiments become available. This research position will likely span three to four quarters depending on how many weekly hours the graduate student is able to devote to the project. The Lab will prioritize applicants that can dedicate at least five hours per week to this project, and that are interested in working with BIL for at least three quarters.

**Job Description:**

BIL is seeking to hire up to two graduate students to review the empirical literature on Universal Basic Income under the supervision of Faculty Director Juliana Bidadanure and with the support of the Program Manager, Sarah Berger Gonzalez. The job entails extensive readings on both the theory and data of basic income. The student will be responsible for email exchanges with leading basic income researchers and experimenters throughout the world to ensure the research platform is comprehensive and accurate.

This graduate student would join two other graduate students who have been actively working on the theory and philosophy of universal basic income. While this position is largely independent, graduate students will hold regular meetings with the Faculty Director and Basic Income Lab Program Manager to coordinate findings and jointly make progress on how to visually present the information. As a graduate fellow, you will also have the opportunity to be involved in the various activities of the lab, including quarterly public events and dinners with speakers.

**How to Apply**

To be considered, please send your CV and a short cover letter to Sarah Berger Gonzalez, Program Manager of the Stanford Basic Income Lab, at basicincomelab@stanford.edu.
