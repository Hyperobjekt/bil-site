BIL is seeking to hire up to two graduate students to review the empirical literature on Universal Basic Income under the supervision of Faculty Director Juliana Bidadanure and with the support of the Program Manager, Sarah Berger Gonzalez. The job entails extensive readings on both the theory and data of basic income. The student will be responsible for email exchanges with leading basic income researchers and experimenters throughout the world to ensure the research platform is comprehensive and accurate.

This graduate student would join two other graduate students who have  been actively working on the theory and philosophy of universal basic income. While this position is largely independent, graduate students will hold regular meetings with the Faculty Director and Basic Income Lab Program Manager to coordinate findings and jointly make progress on how to visually present the information. As a graduate fellow, you will also have the opportunity to be involved in the various activities of the lab, including quarterly public events and dinners with speakers.
