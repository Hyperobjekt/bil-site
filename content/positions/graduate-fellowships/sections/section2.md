The Stanford Basic Income Lab is seeking to recruit up to two graduate students to assist with an extensive review and mapping of research on Universal Basic Income (UBI). The ideal candidate will be trained in Politics, Sociology, Public Policy, or Economics (and related fields) and have a strong interest in learning more about UBI.
â€¨To be considered, please send your CV and a short cover letter to Sarah Berger Gonzalez, Program Manager of the Stanford Basic Income Lab, at basicincomelab@stanford.edu. 

The research project, described below, is already underway but will be ongoing as new literature results from current experiments become available. This research position will likely span three to four quarters depending on how many weekly hours the graduate student is able to devote to the project. The Lab will prioritize applicants that can dedicate at least five  hours per week to this project, and that are interested in working with BIL for at least three quarters.
