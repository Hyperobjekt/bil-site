      <description>The Wesson Discussion Seminar is intended to be a response to the Wesson Lecture delivered by Alan Krueger on Wednesday, March 13.
Discussion Seminar Commentators
JAMES FERGUSON is the Susan S. and William H. Hindle Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences, and Professor in the Department of Anthropology. His research has focused on southern Africa and has engaged a broad range of theoretical and ethnographic issues. These include the politics of “development,” rural-urban migration, changing topographies of property and wealth, constructions of space and place, urban culture in mining towns, experiences of modernity, the spatialization of states, the place of “Africa” in a real and imagined world, and the theory and politics of ethnography.</description>

      <description>This lecture will discuss a form of unconditional cash transfers often called &amp;ldquo;universal basic income&amp;rdquo; (UBI). UBI can be thought of as a form of &amp;ldquo;negative income tax,&amp;rdquo; often with a zero tax rate. Evidence on the incentive effects of UBI in many contexts will be presented. The idea of a negative income tax was supported by a wide range of economists because of its efficiency properties — including James Tobin and Milton Friedman — which makes it surprising that UBI has been so controversial.</description>

      <description>Should basic-income strategies be prioritized over labor organization? Are unconditional cash payments to individuals the proper response to collective problems at the societal level? Join us as our panelists discuss universal basic income as a response to poverty, unemployment and inequality.
Lucas Stanczyk is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Harvard and works on topics at the intersection of political philosophy and political economy. Prior to Harvard, he was an assistant professor of political science and affiliated faculty member of MIT&amp;rsquo;s philosophy department.</description>

      <description>Join us for a conversation with Annie Lowrey, an economics writer and author of &amp;ldquo;Give People Money: How a Universal Basic Income Would End Poverty, Revolutionize Work, and Remake the World.&amp;rdquo; The book examines the concept of a universal basic income (UBI) and why a stipend given to every citizen might be necessary in an age of rising inequality, persistent poverty and dazzling technology.
The book also explores the potential of such a sweeping policy and the challenges the movement faces, among them contradictory aims, uncomfortable costs, and, most powerfully, the entrenched belief that no one should get something for nothing.</description>

      <description>Dorian T. Warren and Mia Birdsong will be explaining how universal basic income can help create a more racially just society. Warren’s presentation will discuss MLK’s and the Black Panther Party’s perspectives on guaranteed income, as well as touching upon how the Movement for Black Lives connects UBI with reparations. Following Warren’s presentation, Birdsong will talk about her Listen First Tour, which highlights the voices of those experiencing economic and racial injustice and the impact UBI would have on them.</description>

      <title>What Can Universal Basic Income Do For Gender Equality?</title>
      <link>/events/2017-10-18-basic-income-gender-equality/</link>

      <description>Free and open to the public. Parking for Cubberley: along Lagunita Drive behind Tresidder Union &amp;amp; in the Wilbur Field Garage. Except for the Oval, all Visitor, &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; spots on campus are available after 4pm.
Some skeptics of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) object to the policy proposal’s component of unconditionality on the grounds of potential exploitation of net payers by net beneficiaries of a UBI. This talk argues that gender inequalities of power and resources, which are largely (but not solely), the result of women’s disproportionate responsibility for care work, must be explicitly highlighted in the argument for the unconditional component of a UBI.</description>
