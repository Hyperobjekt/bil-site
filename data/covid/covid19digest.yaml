herotext: Universal Basic Income COVID-19 Digest
introtext: >-
  The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted gaping holes in safety nets
  globally, leaving vulnerable and marginalized populations worse off, and those
  who were once secure on the verge of falling into poverty. During past
  economic shocks, governments have scaled up existing cash transfer programs
  and implemented new support programs to buffer the social and economic impact
  for individuals and households. Similarly, during this current shock,
  governments are doing the same, though with increasing calls for the
  implementation of a basic income-like policy. 


  As part of the Basic Income Lab’s mission to convene key stakeholders and members of the community around the politics, philosophy and economics of universal basic income, the Lab has put together a “living” digest of tools, research and events from our partners, research institutions and think tanks on basic income during this global pandemic. We encourage you to explore the tools. 


  Should you find something missing or if you would like the Lab to highlight something, we encourage you to email us at basicincomelab@stanford.edu.
policyheader: Policy Tools
policytext: How are past policy responses to global crises informing the
  creation of new policies in response to COVID-19? Are the new policies
  adequate? How are governments across the globe responding to the ever-changing
  current financial, social and health crises? The policy tools included in this
  section address some of these questions through 'living papers' on what the
  social protection responses have been around the world, a set of indicators to
  measure government responses, and a global repository of policy responses to
  address COVID-19, among others.
