  <p>Juliana Bidadanure is an Assistant Professor in the department of Philosophy at Stanford University. Before coming to Stanford, Juliana completed her PhD in Political Philosophy within the School of Politics, Economics and Philosophy at the University of York (UK), and was then a 2014-2015 Max Weber Postdoctoral Fellow at the European University Institute (Italy). Her interests lie at the intersection of Philosophy and Public Policy. She has written on the theory and practice of equality in general, and on age-group justice and what it means to treat young people as equals, in particular.</p> 
  <p>Age-group justice: Julianaâ€™s PhD thesis investigated intergenerational inequalities and asked what governments owe to their young citizens. Inequalities between generations crystallize political and economic tensions. She provided a critical framework that serves to distinguish between acceptable and objectionable inequalities. She engaged with the normative aspects of youth disadvantage and evaluated suitable policies to alleviate youth unemployment, poverty and exclusion. In particular, she wrote on the introduction of youth quotas in parliaments and on the policy proposals of an unconditional basic income for young people.</p>
  <p>Egalitarianism: Juliana has also written on egalitarian theory, and in particular on the distinction between distributive and luck-egalitarian accounts of equality, on the one hand, and relational and social egalitarian frameworks, on the other hand. She is interested in the history, the theory and the practice of equality and will pursue these interests while at Stanford.</p>
  <p>Universal Basic Income: Juliana started by writing on the limitations of the conditional benefits system in France 6 years ago and then researched how basic income compared to basic capital. Basic Capital is a lump sum given to all individuals as they reach adulthood.</p>
