  Sarah joins us from the World Bank where she was a Social Protection Specialist. She has over a decade of experience in developing and managing complex international income support programs aiming to tackle the multi-dimensional elements of poverty through the identification of creative responses to the needs of the most disadvantaged communities in Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe, and Central Asia. Most recently, she developed strategies for Governments on how to link income support beneficiaries with labor market activation programs and other social services.

  <br/> <br/>While doing work on poverty reduction, Berger Gonzalez grew interested in the transformative potential of unconditional cash transfer programs and the impacts they could have on education, health, employment and wellbeing, among other areas.

   <br/> <br/>Prior to the World Bank, Sarah was a Fulbright Scholar in Osorno, Chile researching and working with the indigenous population, the Mapuche. She has a BA in History from Boston College and an MA in Public Policy from Georgetown University.
