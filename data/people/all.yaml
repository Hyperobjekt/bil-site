      <p>Juliana Bidadanure is an Assistant Professor in the department of
      Philosophy at Stanford University. Before coming to Stanford, Juliana
      completed her PhD in Political Philosophy within the School of Politics,
      Economics and Philosophy at the University of York (UK), and was then a
      2014-2015 Max Weber Postdoctoral Fellow at the European University
      Institute (Italy). Her interests lie at the intersection of Philosophy and
      Public Policy. She has written on the theory and practice of equality in
      general, and on age-group justice and what it means to treat young people
      as equals, in particular.</p>  <p>Age-group justice: Juliana’s PhD thesis
      investigated intergenerational inequalities and asked what governments owe
      to their young citizens. Inequalities between generations crystallize
      political and economic tensions. She provided a critical framework that
      serves to distinguish between acceptable and objectionable inequalities.
      She engaged with the normative aspects of youth disadvantage and evaluated
      suitable policies to alleviate youth unemployment, poverty and exclusion.
      In particular, she wrote on the introduction of youth quotas in
      parliaments and on the policy proposals of an unconditional basic income
      for young people.</p> <p>Egalitarianism: Juliana has also written on
      egalitarian theory, and in particular on the distinction between
      distributive and luck-egalitarian accounts of equality, on the one hand,
      and relational and social egalitarian frameworks, on the other hand. She
      is interested in the history, the theory and the practice of equality and
      will pursue these interests while at Stanford.</p> <p>Universal Basic
      Income: Juliana started by writing on the limitations of the conditional
      benefits system in France 6 years ago and then researched how basic income
      compared to basic capital. Basic Capital is a lump sum given to all
      individuals as they reach adulthood.</p> <p>Email:

      Sarah joins us from the World Bank where she was a Social Protection
      Specialist. She has over a decade of experience in developing and managing
      complex international income support programs aiming to tackle the
      multi-dimensional elements of poverty through the identification of
      creative responses to the needs of the most disadvantaged communities in
      Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe, and Central Asia. Most recently,
      she developed strategies for Governments on how to link income support
      beneficiaries with labor market activation programs and other social
      services.

      <br/> <br/>While doing work on poverty reduction, Berger Gonzalez grew
      interested in the transformative potential of unconditional cash transfer
      programs and the impacts they could have on education, health, employment
      and wellbeing, among other areas.

      <br/> <br/>Prior to the World Bank, Sarah was a Fulbright Scholar in
      Osorno, Chile researching and working with the indigenous population, the
      Mapuche. She has a BA in History from Boston College and an MA in Public
      Policy from Georgetown University.

      Sage was drawn to basic income initially through her background in
      technology and witnessing firsthand the wealth automation generates for
      some while leaving others behind. Headlines featuring "robot taxes",
      "impending job loss", and basic income as a future necessity perked her
      ears to what eventually became a year of research on the topic. It turns
      out that basic income is an old idea endorsed internationally for reasons
      not often considered in the Bay Area -- it could encourage work, reduce
      stress, limit societal stigma towards those receiving benefits, and
      increase liberty for those often viewed as undeserving for factors they
      have limited control over. Sage thinkd that basic income should not just
      be seen as a bandaid on a dystopian future, but instead part of a support
      structure for a more stable modern society and economy.


      Currently Sage is designing an application that runs community level UBI
      through philanthropy. This tool will allow people to gain financial
      consciousness of their wealth relative to the cost of living in their area
      and how differing size donations would impact others in their community.
      The idea for the application grew out of my concern for gentrification,
      the slow process to actually implement experiments and create policy
      change, and the extreme wealth inequality in the Bay Area that is mirrored
      in other parts of the globe.


      In order to build the application, Sage seeks to understand what makes one
      willing and happy to give or take funds and what size community makes
      people the most generous and also leaves the greatest impact. These
      questions are addressed in her master's thesis, "Automation: The Curse and
      the Cure: Why Tech Companies have an Ethical Responsibility to Assist in
      Economic Security," which more generally addresses problems of poverty,
      inequality and technology.

      Having worked in and researched international development for several
      years, Catherine was inspired by growing evidence on the effectiveness of
      unconditional and conditional cash transfers on improving wellbeing,
      health, and economic outcomes. This is especially important in the midst
      of disappointing results on the impact of most economic development
      interventions. Catherine believes that universal basic income is a
      promising strategy for advancing evidence-based social policy and more
      inclusive societies. She brings her background in psychology to bear on
      her studies of UBI, exploring how psychological insights can increase the
      effectiveness of and support for cash-based welfare.


      Through laboratory and field experiments in the US and in Kenya, Catherine
      examines how psychological insights can be applied to increase the
      effectiveness of and support for cash-based welfare, including universal
      basic income. In particular, she is interested in understanding how the
      ways in which universal basic income policies are communicated not only
      influence translation to policy but also potentially the effectiveness of
      the policy on behavioral and wellbeing outcomes.


      Catherine examines, first, how values-based messages of universal basic
      income affect policy support and affect stigmatizing attitudes against
      low-income populations among the general public in the US. Second, she
      assesses how such messages, in turn, differentially influence agency,
      self-investment behaviors, stigma, and support for such policies among
      low-income populations in the US and in Kenya.
