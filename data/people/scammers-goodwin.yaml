  Sage was drawn to basic income initially through her background in technology and witnessing firsthand the wealth automation generates for some while leaving others behind. Headlines featuring "robot taxes", "impending job loss", and basic income as a future necessity perked her ears to what eventually became a year of research on the topic. It turns out that basic income is an old idea endorsed internationally for reasons not often considered in the Bay Area -- it could encourage work, reduce stress, limit societal stigma towards those receiving benefits, and increase liberty for those often viewed as undeserving for factors they have limited control over. Sage thinkd that basic income should not just be seen as a bandaid on a dystopian future, but instead part of a support structure for a more stable modern society and economy.

  <br><br>Currently Sage is designing an application that runs community level UBI through philanthropy. This tool will allow people to gain financial consciousness of their wealth relative to the cost of living in their area and how differing size donations would impact others in their community. The idea for the application grew out of my concern for gentrification, the slow process to actually implement experiments and create policy change, and the extreme wealth inequality in the Bay Area that is mirrored in other parts of the globe.

  <br><br>In order to build the application, Sage seeks to understand what makes one willing and happy to give or take funds and what size community makes people the most generous and also leaves the greatest impact. These questions are addressed in her master's thesis, "Automation: The Curse and the Cure: Why Tech Companies have an Ethical Responsibility to Assist in Economic Security," which more generally addresses problems of poverty, inequality and technology.
