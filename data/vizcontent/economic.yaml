      This section discusses UBI’s potential effects on savings and investment.


      **Summary**


      For many people, one of the most important objectives of UBI is to reduce poverty. The hope is that UBI would not only help people meet their daily needs, but also provide the basis for a more secure life by facilitating investments in asset accumulation and human capital development, both of which provide pathways out of poverty. 


      Other welfare or cash assistance policies place limits on what assets an individual can hold in order to receive support, or they reduce the level of assistance an individual receives if he or she has income from wages or earnings. But UBI is an income floor, or ‘base,’ which means it may then allow for savings and investment of additional income into productive assets. Savings create a pathway out of poverty because it helps relax credit constraints that limit people’s ability to make bigger purchases—such as farming equipment or housing improvements—that contribute to long-term income (Banerjee et al., 2019). Savings also act as a safety net for people to participate in productive activities such as education and take up riskier enterprises such as entrepreneurship (Banerjee et al., 2019; Hoynes & Rothstein, 2019). 


      While evidence of the impact of UBI on savings is scarce for high-income countries, evidence in low- and middle-income settings robustly supports the notion that UBI encourages savings. Evidence from Kenya’s GiveDirectly unconditional cash experiment, for example, led to significant increases in savings in the short run (Haushofer & Shapiro, 2016), as did unconditional cash transfer programs in Zambia (Handa et al., 2018; Natali et al., 2016). Conditional cash transfer programs (Angelucci et al., 2012; Covarrubias et al., 2012) have arrived at similar conclusions. Moreover, there is some evidence that the savings effect may persist for several years. In the Kenyan experiment, recipients still held 40 percent more assets and financial savings than non-recipients three years after the transfer (Haushofer & Shapiro, 2018). The more long-term durability is less clear, with one study indicating that the effect on savings diminished over nine years (Blattman et al., 2018).


      How much of the extra income from UBI do people invest? Most studies of cash transfer programs in developing countries suggest people invest a large proportion of the overall amount. In the GiveDirectly experiment, differences in assets were largely driven by investments in productive assets such as livestock and durables (Haushofer & Shapiro, 2016). In Malawi, unconditional cash transfers to low-income households led to significantly increased investment in agricultural assets (Covarrubias et al., 2012). In Mexico, recipients of the Oportunidades conditional cash transfers were found to invest 26 percent of their extra income, increasing agricultural income by 10 percent per person after 18 months (Gertler et al., 2012).  A conditional cash transfer program in Nicaragua, however, was found to have no significant impact on either agricultural or non-agricultural investment (Malucci, 2010). 


      The types of assets that people invest in are also influenced by economics opportunities where they live. In poorer areas, people tend to invest their income from cash transfers in basic durable goods, such as metal roofs (Haushofer & Shapiro, 2016), while individuals in agricultural economies are more likely to invest in agricultural assets such as livestock and crop implements (Covarrubias et al., 2012; Gertler et al., 2012). Across contexts, people invest a significant proportion of their extra income in human capital, such as health and education. Robust evidence from Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa shows that cash transfers boosted school enrolment, especially for girls, and healthcare spending, especially on children (Barrientos & DeJong, 2006; Davis et al., 2012; Fiszbein et al., 2019). In Canada, male adolescents in Manitoba deferred entering the workforce in order to continue school attendance (Forget, 2011). 


      Several other factors related to the design features of the transfer and the contextual conditions where it is delivered are also relevant for UBI’s effect on savings and investment. The frequency of payment, for example, was found to affect savings in Kenya (Haushofer & Shapiro, 2018), with more/less frequent payments associated with greater spending on durable goods. While research from high-income contexts is scarce, there is some evidence to suggest differences in patterns of savings and investment. The most evidence for UBI’s impact on savings is from lower-income contexts where individuals face more severe credit constraints, while less is known about contexts where credit is more readily accessible. Evidence from a conditional cash transfer program in Mexico shows that urban recipients who enjoyed more access to credit than their rural counterparts used the cash transfers to pay off debts, and that savings was a smaller proportion of their income (Angelucci et al., 2012).  In the case of the Alaska Permanent Dividend Fund (PDF), a universal transfer, the way that transfers are used may be related to a recipient’s income. For example, researchers theorized that an increase in economic inequality was due to differences in how the disbursement was used, with high-income households directing the transfer to investments, increasing the wealth gap (Kozminski & Baek, 2017).


      What are alternatives to UBI in alleviating income inequality? We know that ownership of income-generating assets is an important source of income inequality (Birdsall & Londodo, 1997). So, one alternative to UBI is “basic capital”—a relatively large, unconditional, one-time, lump-sum grant, given to every adult in a community (Alstott & Ackerman, 1999; White, 2011). Basic capital has one important advantage over UBI: it allows recipients to invest a larger proportion of their grants upfront, thus offering more opportunity than UBI for low-income individuals to own income-generating assets. Basic capital, however, has limitations of its own and the proposed amount is generally smaller than the total amount of UBI over the long run.


      Overall, while more evidence from advanced economies is needed, the evidence on UBI’s positive effects on savings and investment is promising. More research is also needed on how program factors (such as frequency of payment) affect savings and investment, and on which groups (based on factors such as income, gender, or family composition) see the largest effects.
