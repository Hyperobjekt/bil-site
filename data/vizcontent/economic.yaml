      <i>This section explores how UBI might improve governance in democracies, in particular by examining how UBI may 
      impact democratic accountability and legitimacy.</i>
      
      As a regime type, democracy is often valued for certain intrinsic characteristics, such as how it manifests citizen equality. 
      But there are also instrumental reasons for valuing democracy, including the fact that it may result in better governance. 
      Democracies may be both more legitimate and more accountable than other forms of government, resulting in policies that 
      are better for citizens. If democracies fail to be accountable or legitimate—that is, to embody these values of good 
      governance—it may contribute to democratic dissatisfaction and the desire for alternative regime types. Globally, 
      dissatisfaction with how democracy is working is on the rise; across 27 countries polled, a median of 51 percent 
      of people were dissatisfied with the current functioning of democracy in their countries (Richard Wike et al., 2019). 
      People who considered their governments to be unaccountable (corrupt or unable to improve standards of living) or 
      illegitimate (untrustworthy or unwilling to respect basic rights) were more likely to be dissatisfied.If we value 
      democracy because of its association with good governance, we may ask what impact UBI would have on the ability 
      of democracies to govern well. Evidence from cash transfers offers insights on accountability and legitimacy—the 
      two values thought necessary for good governance.How might UBI impact the ability of citizens to hold their governments 
      accountable? Insofar as a UBI is likely to increase voter turnout or citizen participation, it could very well 
      increase government accountability. However, it is not enough that citizens merely participate; in order to 
      ensure good governance, how they participate matters as well. “Unhealthy” political engagement, when citizens 
      select and sanction leaders on the basis of their provision of private goods, can damage the state’s ability 
      to govern (Khemani, 2015). Unhealthy civic participation, for example, can be seen in special interests’ 
      groups who mobilize to extract benefits from policies at the expense of public interest. Civic participation 
      is “healthy” when citizens select and sanction leaders on their ability to provide public goods. An example of 
      healthy participation might include sanctioning leaders for corruption by voting them out of office. UBI, which is 
      both a public and a private good, complicates the boundary between healthy and unhealthy civic engagement. 
      On the one hand, reduced economic dependency may empower citizens to monitor their government and to elect 
      responsive leadership. Yet evidence from conditional cash transfers has shown there are also cases in which 
      the policy could reduce the independence of voters, making them more likely to vote for the incumbent 
      (Baez et al., 2012). Vote-buying—the process of offering gifts or money in exchange for votes—is robustly 
      correlated with lower quality of public services across countries (World Bank, 2016). If politicians use the 
      direct benefit of UBI to ‘buy’ votes (for example, by promising increased payments), it may hinder the ability of 
      citizens to remove those leaders in the case of other infractions. It is possible, however, that such an effect 
      could be mitigated by UBI’s universality; the fact that even higher-income citizens would receive the benefit might 
      prevent the emergence of a “Curley effect”—a phenomenon whereby politicians increase the size of their political base, 
      ensuring reelection, via policies that provide distortionary benefits (Glaeser & Shleifer, 2002). A related fear 
      regarding UBI and accountability is that voter interest in UBI might outweigh other important concerns regarding 
      the public good. Some have argued, for instance, that the annual dividend from Alaska’s Permanent Fund has “warped” 
      local politics, because residents vote to protect their individual payments to the detriment of public services 
      such as schools and universities (Sundlee, 2019). This is important since, when policies provide targeted benefits, 
      as a cash transfer does, there may often be fewer resources available for other types of services, such as public 
      health or education (Khemani, 2019). Evidence is mixed, however, as recent polls demonstrate that voters would be 
      willing to consider capping their Permanent Fund dividend payments or directing additional earnings from the Permanent 
      Fund towards public services and programs (Stalzer, 2015). More research is required to understand the relationship 
      between UBI and voter interest in the provision of public goods.A large part of the perception of a government as 
      legitimate relies on citizen perception that the government is accountable. So, insofar as UBI were to increase 
      democratic accountability, it would also increase democratic legitimacy.But another axis of democratic legitimacy is 
      social cohesion, which is known in some scholarly work as social capital or social connectedness. Social cohesion has 
      been found in empirical studies to impact the health of democracies, as it is often associated with improved institutional 
      performance, economic prosperity, increased mobilization and participation, and general sense of citizen efficacy 
      (Campbell, 2013; Putnam et al., 1994; Rosenstone & Hansen, 2009). Economic inequality, such as highly unequal incomes, 
      and social inequality, such as the existence of unequal rewards and opportunities for various social positions, have 
      been found in empirical research to negatively impact social cohesion (Khambule & Siswana, 2017; Vergolini, 2011; 
      Wilkinson, 1997). Insofar as UBI may be able to reduce economic and social inequalities, it could possibly contribute 
      to increase social cohesion.Another way in which UBI might increase social cohesion is by changing how people use their 
      time. If people have more time for activities in which they engage with others, such as getting an education or 
      participating in volunteer work, they may have wider social networks and thus create more social cohesion. But a UBI 
      could also have a negative impact on social cohesion. Recipients of a UBI may decide to spend more time at home or 
      in networks that they already have, which could possibly decrease social cohesion. So, because there is no empirical 
      research on what types of activities people might be expected to participate in should they receive a UBI, it is difficult 
      to estimate the impact it could have on social cohesion. Moreover, it has been argued that workplaces play a critical 
      integrative role within democracies; economic necessity forces people of diverse backgrounds and ethnicities to work 
      together, and this daily interaction causes them to build personal ties across social divisions and practice the skills 
      of compromise and consensus (Estlund, 2003). If a UBI means that people are no longer required to work with those with 
      whom they would not otherwise choose to associate, it could, in the long run, decrease social cohesion and thus negatively 
      impact social cohesion and democratic legitimacy. UBI’s potential impact on social cohesion is therefore highly variable, 
      and there is a dearth of evidence to support any oneconclusion. More research is needed.UBI might also impact the trust 
      that citizens have in the state, which is yet another axis of democratic legitimacy. A basic income that is truly universal 
      creates a service that is accessed by every citizen, from the least to most well off. Consistent citizen engagement with 
      government services may serve to increase the legitimacy of the state as a whole, especially if those services are 
      considered particularly important or competent. The Bolsa Familia program in Brazil demonstrated that transfer recipients 
      showed increased trust in core state institutions, local government, and incumbent actors (Layton et al., 2017). A 
      randomized control trial in Tanzania showed that conditional cash transfers significantly increased trust inelected 
      leaders with a concomitant rise in the perception of government responsiveness to citizen concerns and perceived honesty 
      of leaders (Evans et al., 2018). However, in this trial, the cash transfers were in part implemented via in-person 
      monitoring by elected officials and were conditional on accessing other services, such as healthcare. It is possible that 
      some of the impact on legitimacy is a result of these direct citizen-to-government interactions; if this is the case, 
      an online UBI might actually decrease social trust as citizens engage less often with various government bureaucracies. 
      It may not be necessary for there to be personal contact between citizens and government officials for there to be 
      increased legitimacy, however; digitized or online services that are sufficiently competent might have the same effect. 
      Indeed, an online UBI might even improve perceptions of government legitimacy more, as it removes some possibilities for 
      corruption and micro-domination in service-provision. First, such a UBI “shortens the chain” between government and 
      citizens; removing hands through which the money must pass can result in more transparency and less corruption 
      (World Bank, 2003). Second, it may make service-provision more equitable. “Street level” bureaucrats, those at the 
      forefront of service provision, can be perceived by recipients as making arbitrary decisions about who canaccess 
      benefits, for what reasons, and when. Removing this element of discretion in personal interaction may actually 
      improve citizen-government interactions, and the net impact of UBI might be an increase in democratic trust. 
      Preliminary results from the Finnish basic income experiment support such a conclusion, as researchers there found 
      that basic income recipients had a small but significant increase in trust in politicians and the legal system 
      relative to the control group (Kangas et al., 2019). The leveling of economic inequality may also contribute to 
      such an effect; because citizens in a democracy are serviced by other citizens, micro-domination weakens social trust 
      and the overarching legitimacy of the political community. If micro-domination is more likely to impact low-income 
      citizens, then reduced inequality may make other forms of service provision—from schooling to healthcare—seem fairer, 
      and the state itself more legitimate.
