  This section discusses how UBI could potentially increase access to health care services, therefore
  contributing to healthier communities.

  
  **Summary**
  
  
  Access to health care services is central to promoting and maintaining one’s health, preventing and
  managing illness and disease, reducing unnecessary disability and premature death, and achieving health
  equity (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, n.d.) . Research has shown that access to care
  (inclusive of dental care) varies by race and ethnicity, income, age, gender, geographic or residential
  location, and sexual orientation (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2018; Chattopadhyay,
  2008) . Barriers in access to health services—including high cost of care, inadequate or no insurance
  coverage, lack of availability of services, or lack of culturally competent care—often contribute to
  variation across these different groups.
  
  
  Many of the social determinants of health intersect with these barriers (Bhatt &amp; Bathija, 2018) . In 2015,
  23.4 percent of adults (18–64 years) living in poverty or just above the poverty line in the United States
  cited cost as the top reason for not obtaining needed medical care at least once during the last 12 months
  (Martinez &amp; Ward, 2016) . Those living in poverty face economic insecurity and therefore have limited
  capacity to pay out-of-pocket health care costs (Lauren Frohlich et al., 2015) . Moreover, despite the
  Affordable Care Act of 2010 that mandated medical insurance for all in the United States, in 2017, over
  10 percent of adults had no medical insurance. In that same year, 61.6 percent had prescriptive drug
  insurance, and only 54.5 percent had dental insurance (Office of Disease Prevention and Health
  Promotion, n.d.) . Access to health care services is also complicated by where one lives and the
  availability of services. In rural parts of the United States, where poverty is the greatest, there are 40
  physicians per 100,000 persons compared to nearly 54 physicians per 100,000 in urban areas (Hostetter &amp;
  Klein, 2017) .
  
  
  Acknowledging the complexity of health care insurance markets and the variation in quality health care
  services available, an increase in an individual’s income could plausibly have an impact on access to
  health care services. While more research is needed to understand whether and how UBI could boost
  access to healthcare, especially in the United States, UBI could improve access to preventative health care
  services thus reducing the incidence of disease and more expensive health care services (Ruckert et al.,
  2018) .
  
  
  India and Namibia’s basic income experiments both contributed to increased access to health care
  services. In the Madhya Pradesh experiment, the basic income led to an increase in private health care use
  (from 50 percent to 65 percent) because of geographic proximity to the village and because the quality of
  the care was perceived to be better. These rates of use were sustained well after the experiment (Davala et
  al., 2017) . In Namibia, prior to the experiment, poverty prevented many in Otijivero-Omitara from
  seeking services. During the experiment, though, expenditures at the local health clinic increased by an
  average of five times each month than what was normally spent without the additional income (Haarmann
  et al., 2009) . Finally, even in countries where universal healthcare is publicly funded, a basic income
  would give individuals an opportunity to access more specialized care beyond the health services and
  medications available to them under universal healthcare.
  
  
  A UBI could also possibly guarantee more equitable access to drugs in countries where no public or
  private drug insurance plans are available (Ruckert et al., 2018) . In the United States, given the
  exponential rise in cost of lifesaving drugs, access to appropriate medication is increasingly difficult to
  afford (Kesselheim et al., 2016) . As such, a universal income could reduce some of the barriers to
  accessing necessary medicines and make access to medicine more equitable (Ruckert et al., 2018) . In the
  Namibia basic income experiment, there was an increase in antiretroviral (ARV) treatment among
  patients with HIV (from 3 to 36 individuals). While this increase is notable, it is important to
  acknowledge that during the experiment, the government was also implementing an ARV rollout. As aresult, it is difficult to attribute this increase in use of lifesaving drugs to the basic income intervention
  itself. Additional research and data are needed to determine what sort of impact a basic income could
  have on access to medicine.
  
  
  Finally, a UBI may increase one’s access to dental health services and therefore reduce the risk factors
  associated with oral diseases and other chronic diseases (Chen &amp; Quiñonez, 2018) . While many
  developed countries provide universal healthcare, universal coverage of dental health care schemes is
  rare; Austria, Mexico, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom,
  for example, do not offer universal dental health care. Moreover, it is often the case that countries who do
  cover dental services often neglect critical services (Biggs, 2012) . Many of the risk factors associated
  with chronic diseases are also applicable for oral diseases, such as diet and hygiene, smoking, alcohol,
  risky behaviors causing injuries, and stress (Sheiham, 2005) . A UBI could reduce the aforementioned risk
  factors through improving an individual’s income security, thus allowing them to have more time and
  resources to access both mitigative and responsive oral health care services (Chen &amp; Quiñonez, 2018) .

  **Summary**


  Adults in the United States living in poverty are more than five times as likely to report fair or poor health
  as adults with a median income (Braveman &amp; Egerter, 2013; Office of the Assistant Secretary for
  Planning and Evaluation, 2019) . Low-income adults in the United States have higher rates of heart
  disease, diabetes, stroke, coronary heart disease, chronic arthritis and other chronic diseases compared to
  wealthier individuals in the United States (Schiller et al., 2012) . This burden is shared by children living
  in poverty who experience higher rates of asthma, heart conditions, hearing problems, digestive disorders,
  and elevated blood levels. Children living in poverty are also more exposed to risk factors for medical
  conditions such as childhood obesity than children in higher income households (Woolf et al., 2015).


  Strong evidence suggests that an absolute increase in an individual’s income floor would directly improve
  health outcomes (Benzeval et al., 2014; Braveman et al., 2010, 2011; Woolf et al., 2015) . There remains
  much debate, however, about the specific causal pathways that link income and health. The pathways are
  complex both between income groups and across the life cycle; they intersect with where an individual
  lives (geographical location), the access they have to services, and the cultural context of an individual’s
  life (school, work, community). The pathways are also bi-directional and inter-generational (Benzeval et
  al., 2014) . While complex, individuals with greater income tend to be able to afford health care services
  and health insurance, engage in healthier lifestyles, live in more advantageous communities, and have
  income for coping from ill health (Benzeval et al., 2014; Woolf et al., 2015).


  Recognizing the complexities of the casual pathways that link income and health, a UBI could still serve
  as a key component to addressing some of the challenges in population health. A UBI could possibly
  minimize the health risks associated with higher rates of chronic disease and illness among adults and
  children by addressing the underlying socioeconomic and environmental circumstances (Mah, 2017) .
  These health risks include increased tobacco use, raised blood pressure, physical inactivity, unhealthy
  diet, and harmful use of alcohol (Public Health Agency Canada, 2015). Economic insecurity, among other
  socioeconomic circumstances, has been shown to contribute to chronic stress, and therefore to impact
  these risks and result in worse health outcomes (Forget, 2018).


  UBI could minimize these risks because it serves as a form of income security or insurance, whether or
  not an individual works (Forget, 2011) . For those receiving the basic income in the Finland basic income
  experiment (2017–2018), for example, self-perceived levels of stress were lower than for those not
  participating. Because 54.8 percent of participants considered their health to be very good or good relative
  to 46.2 percent of nonparticipants, it is possible that lower stress contributed to a better perception of
  one’s overall health and wellbeing (Kangas et al., 2019) . Moreover, empirical data from the Canadian
  MINCOME (1975–1978) showed an 8.5 percent decline in hospitalizations related to accidents and
  injuries (Forget, 2011) - including those injuries that are highly correlated with income insecurity induced
  stress, such as, car accidents, children suffering from accidents while parents are out harvesting, and
  alcohol induced injuries.


  One’s health is also determined by social factors such as where one lives and the civic and economic
  vitality of one’s community. But, increasingly, income inequality is making it difficult for individuals to
  afford to live in healthier, more advantageous communities (Forget, 2018) . Those who live in less
  advantageous communities often experience higher levels of chronic stress and face challenges with a
  number of community-level health-related factors (access to healthy food, affordable housing,
  transportation, school systems, jobs and health care, environmental pollution, among others) (Benzeval et
  al., 2014; Woolf et al., 2015).


  If a UBI was funded progressively, it could reduce some of the health inequities among individuals living
  in low income communities by allowing for increased access to quality services and housing (Ruckert et
  al., 2018) . Results from the U.S.-run New Jersey Income Maintenance Experiment (1968–1972), the Gary
  Maintenance Income Experiment (1971–1974), and the Denver and Seattle Maintenance Income
  Experiments (1971–1982) showed that those receiving the income transfer tended to have higher mobility
  rates than households in the control groups (positive effects on private rental expenses) (Kaluzny, 1979) .
  In the Gary experiment, poor housing conditions and dissatisfaction with current dwelling conditions
  were positively related to mobility (Kaluzny, 1979).

  While there is a relationship between income and health outcomes, additional research is needed to
  understand how a basic income dispersed universally would play out on health disparities across different
  income levels and in different country contexts with varying healthcare systems.

  negative mental health outcomes.
  
  
  **Summary**


  Mental health disorders have become increasingly common in the United States. In 2017, nearly one in
  five adults aged 18 or older (or 18.9 percent of all adults) were living with a mental illness. Of those
  individuals, 4.5 percent had a serious mental illness with greater prevalence among women and young
  adults under 25 (National Institute of Mental Health, 2019) . Mental health problems and disorders are
  complex outcomes, shaped by biological and psychological factors and by the social, economic, and
  physical environments in which people live (Lund, 2018) . Communities facing stark social inequalities,
  financial strain, limited education, unemployment, and adverse neighborhood characteristics are
  associated with an increased risk of developing a variety of mental disorders, including depression,
  anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder or substance use disorder (Allen et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2016).


  Mental health disorders have wide-ranging social, economic and health consequences for individuals and
  families as well as local and larger communities. The social and economic costs of mental illness, both
  direct (medication, clinic visits, or hospitalization) and indirect (reduced labor supply, public income
  support payments, reduced educational attainment, or costs associated with homelessness and
  incarceration) (Insel, 2008) are shared widely and have lasting and profound effects. On a macro level,
  serious mental disorders cost the United States an estimated $200 billion in lost earnings per year (Insel,
  2008) ; and, in 2013, the United States spent $71 billion to treat depressive disorders—the most costly
  among mental health and substance abuse disorders (Dieleman et al., 2016) . In 2017, the City of San
  Francisco was spending an estimated $370 million a year providing behavioral health services to more
  than 30,000 individuals (Tipping Point Community &amp; University of California, San Francisco, 2019).


  Addressing, managing, and reducing mental health disorders would necessarily require a multi-pronged
  approach. It would be a mistake to think that a cash program alone could resolve such a profound issue.
  But UBI can, nonetheless, help improve mental health and reduce the risk of mental health disorders by
  improving an individual’s financial security and mobility.


  First, a generous UBI program could reduce economic insecurity, thereby decreasing stress (Ruckert et
  al., 2018) . Economic insecurity is increasingly cited as one of the key socioeconomic determinants of
  mental health (Allen et al., 2014; Kopasker et al., 2018; Lund, 2018) . The basic income experiment in
  Finland (2017–2018), albeit brief, showed signs of stress reduction among participants relative to non-
  participants: 54.8 percent of participants reported little to no stress relative to 45.6 percent of non-basic
  income recipients (Kangas et al., 2019).


  Results from negative income tax experiments, dividends, and unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) also
  highlight the positive effects of increased economic security on self-esteem, stress, anxiety and worry.
  The Mincome experiment in Manitoba, Canada, in the late 1970s showed an 8.5 percent decline in
  hospitalization rates largely due to a decline in mental health issues related to alcohol consumption
  (Forget, 2011, 2013) . More recent qualitative data from the prematurely cancelled Ontario Basic Income
  Pilot indicated reductions in posttraumatic stress and chronic health problems (Forget, 2019) .
  
  
  Other regularly dispersed unconditional cash transfer programs have also improved mental health. A
  longitudinal study on the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians examined the psychiatric outcomes following
  the opening of a casino and bi-yearly income payments; it found that those families who were poor before
  the casino and came out of poverty after it opened had a notable reduction in children’s psychiatric
  disorders (symptoms of conduct and oppositional defiant disorders) (Costello et al., 2003) .
  
  
  Research from low- and middle-income countries also points to the positive impact of unconditional cash
  on mental health. In the pilot implemented by the NGO Give Directly in Western Kenya between 2011
  and 2012, the cash transfer contributed to increases in happiness and life satisfaction as well as a reduction in stress. In the same pilot, large single lump-sum transfers (rather than regular monthly
  transfers) led to a reduction in levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. Women also experienced a greater
  “reduction in worries and increase in self-esteem” relative to men, when receiving the transfer (Haushofer
  &amp; Shapiro, 2016) . Finally, a UCT Program for Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Kenya showed a
  reduction in depressive symptoms by 24 percent among young persons living in households that received
  cash transfers, relative to those who did not (Kilburn et al., 2016).


  Moreover, unlike conditional cash transfer programs or traditional welfare programs, the unconditional
  feature of a UBI policy could also have important effects on individuals’ mental health. When recipients
  know that they will receive the cash without having to meet any conditions—and that they are able to
  choose what they want to do with it—UBI may reduce anxiety and stress (Mah, 2017) . For instance, the
  recipients of the Canadian unconditional income grant for senior citizens (Old Age Supplement, or OAS)
  self-reported better mental health outcomes than the recipients of conditional Canadian assistance
  programs (McIntyre et al., 2016) . Data indicated that the stringent eligibility criteria of some of the
  current income assistance programs in Canada often left individuals dependent on these programs feeling
  stressed, marginalized, disempowered and hopeless. In contrast, low-income seniors who received the
  OAS faced less administrative restrictions (McIntyre et al., 2016).


  A cash transfer experiment in Malawi also found that schoolgirls who received an unconditional cash
  transfer were approximately 14 percentage points less likely to be suffering from psychological distress
  relative to the control group. Schoolgirls receiving the cash transfer conditional on regular school
  attendance, however, only had a 6-percentage point decline in psychological distress (Baird et al., 2013) .
  The data suggests that the higher level of psychological distress among girls with the school attendance
  conditionality may be attributed to the burden of meeting the conditions (Baird et al., 2013) .
  
  
  UBI may also indirectly impact wellbeing by reducing workers’ dependence on insecure or low-wage
  jobs. Precariousness represents a significant mental burden and can increase levels of anger, anomie,
  anxiety, and alienation (Standing, 2016) . Over the last few decades in the United States, the rise of the gig
  economy, the outsourcing of jobs, and the decline in real wage earnings have been shown to contribute to
  outcomes associated with negative mental wellness, including an increase in alcoholic liver disease, drug
  poisoning, and suicide among less educated (high school or less) white Americans (Case &amp; Deaton,
  2020) . In the United Kingdom, males facing work-related insecurity (or the threat of workplace
  insecurity) often had the highest rate of mental health related illnesses (Kopasker et al., 2018) . A UBI
  would only have a limited impact in reducing the occupational insecurities associated with outsourcing or
  the gig economy, but if it were to help transform precocity and unemployment from a state of insecurity
  to a state of voluntary flexibility, then it could plausibly also improve mental health (Srnicek &amp; Williams,
  2015).


  Where one lives is also a critical social determinant of mental health. Those who live in adverse
  neighborhoods with higher levels of violence and crime, stark social inequalities, and fewer employment
  and educational opportunities have less community connectedness and greater social isolation,
  contributing to an increase in mental health issues (Silva et al., 2016) . A UBI could possibly give people
  increased access to housing in neighborhoods with higher quality community services and community
  participation. Results from the U.S.-run Gary Maintenance Income Experiment between 1971 and 1974
  showed that those receiving the income transfer tended to move to neighborhoods with better housing and
  health providers, thereby reducing the risks to mental health outlined above (Ruckert et al., 2018) . That
  said, it is difficult to infer that the data from the income experiments would necessarily contribute to that
  type of mobility under a UBI, given that all households would be receiving the same income. Additional
  research designs are needed to determine the effects of universal programs on communities as a whole.
  
  
  Finally, the payment frequency of a UBI may impact mental health outcomes. While the pathways are
  complex, research has shown that when some individuals with mental health disorders are already highly
  indebted, they have a propensity for manic, nihilistic, social value, comfort, impulsive, and addictive
  spending (Holkar &amp; Mackenzie, 2016) . If a UBI payment were to be more regular and predictable (as opposed to irregular large cash payments or a single lump sum) it may contribute to a reduction in poor
  outcomes and financial stress, and therefore improved mental health. Evidence from a cousin of basic
  income (Chicago Earned Income Tax Credit periodic payment pilot) has shown that regular, predictable
  payments contributed to a reduction of financial stress and an increase in overall wellbeing (Kramer et al.,
  2019) . Additional research is needed, though, to fully understand how, if at all, the frequency of a UBI
  would impact mental wellbeing and what wrap-around services, if any, would need to accompany the
  transfer.
