  The Lab will be hosting three events this academic year: 


  * A practitioner's workshop in winter quarter 2020, **_What's in a Name?_**
  that aims to examine the variety of names that have been given to universal
  basic income (guaranteed income, base income, basic income guarantee, freedom
  dividend) and related programs (Negative Income Tax, EITC). The workshop will
  explore the ethical values underpinning different versions of the proposal and
  draw on the insights of history, political science, and social psychology to
  understand what is at stake when one name is used v. another. 

  * A public discussion in spring quarter 2020 on _**UBI and Food Security**_ 

  * A public launch event of the **_online mapping of basic income literature_**
  in fall 2020
