      The year is 2050- the world's population is nearing the 10 billion mark,
      artificial intelligence is integral to many of the jobs we do, and robots
      and technological "personal assistants" are the new norm in the
      workforce.  So will there be enough paid work to go around?  Martin Ford
      is a US based futurist who has written a number of books including "The
      Rise of the Robots-technology and the threat of a jobless future". He says
      one answer to an impending jobs shortage is a universal basic income for
      all.  And Juliana Bidadanure is faculty director of Stanford University's
      Basic Income Lab where these ideas are being researched and explored.
