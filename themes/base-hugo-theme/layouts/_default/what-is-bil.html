<!--      WHY BASIC INCOME       -->

            <h2 class="mb-3">Why Basic Income?</h2>
            <p class="medgraytext">In Silicon Valley, and increasingly in the United States, many individuals have expressed their support for Universal Basic Income, viewing it as providing a safety net for those who are already marginalized from the labor market as well as those who, because of increasing automation, may be displaced in the future. Y Combinator Research went further and set aside millions of dollars to experiment with unconditional cash among low-income households. 
                Stanford, nestled in the heart of the bay area, excels in both engineering and the social sciences, providing BIL access to experts across disciplines to make contributions to UBI research.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-3">Why Now?</h2>
                <p class="medgraytext">In 2016, the policy proposal for Universal Basic Income grew more favorable in the United States. 
                    In that year alone, Martin Ford (author of Rise of the Robots), Robert B. Reich (former Secretary of Labor), and Andrew Stern (former President of the SEIU), among others all published books putting forward a Universal Basic Income as an innovative and essential policy tool for confronting economic insecurity. 
                    Since then, dozens of other books and research articles have been written and basic income pilots have sprung up throughout the United States and around the world.
