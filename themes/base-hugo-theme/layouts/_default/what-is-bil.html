            <p class="medgraytext mt-md-1">The Stanford Basic Income Lab aspires to be an academic home for the study of universal basic income. We review the vast interdisciplinary research produced on UBI, identify under-explored research questions, and help shape future directions in basic income research. The lab both guides researchers and experimenters who seek to conduct innovative research on UBI and hires scholars to produce new research. BIL also convenes key stakeholders and members of the community around the politics, philosophy and economics of basic income and informs policymakers and practitioners about best practices in UBI experimentation.</p>
            <p class="medgraytext mt-md-1">The purpose of the Basic Income Lab is to foster research and promote a more informed public discussion about basic income and its potential to alleviate poverty, precariousness and inequality.</p>
            <p class="medgraytext mt-md-1">The Stanford Basic Income Lab was founded in February 2017 as an initiative of the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society. Under the leadership of Associate Professor Juliana Bidadanure and the support and guidance of Joan Berry, Executive Director of the McCoy Family Center of Ethics in Society, the Basic Income Lab received seed funding from the Economic Security Project and the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society to create an academic home for the study and evaluation of basic income experiments.

<!--      WHY BASIC INCOME       -->

            <h2 class="mb-3">Why Basic Income?</h2>
            <p class="medgraytext">As automation, growing inequalities, increasing poverty, social precariousness and structural unemployment grow in relevance both in the United States and around the world, many experts have looked at alternative proposals to address these issues.
                </p>
            <p class="medgraytext">From this debate, Universal Basic Income (UBI) has emerged as an interesting alternative to deal with some of the largest issues faced by the world today. 
                </p> 
                
                <p class="medgraytext">    Within this context, there is an increasing need for in-depth academic research on how to design, implement and evaluate UBI; what UBIâ€™s potential impacts could be; and, how feasible it would be to implement.

                <h2 class="mb-3">Why Here?                    </h2>
                <p class="medgraytext">In Silicon Valley, and increasingly in the United States, many individuals have expressed their support for Universal Basic Income due to a vast array of reasons. Some argue for it as providing a safety net for those who are already marginalized from the labor market; some support it as a measure to protect workers which may be displaced in the future due to increasing automation; and others defend it as a mechanism to provide real freedom to citizens. 
                    </p>
                <p class="medgraytext">Stanford offers a unique set of interdisciplinary opportunities to further enhance the study of this proposal. Nestled in the heart of the bay area, the university excels in both engineering and the social sciences, providing BIL access to experts across disciplines to make contributions to UBI research.
